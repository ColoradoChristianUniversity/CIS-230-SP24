# Week 1 Ethics Response
## Question:
While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employerâ€™s second largest customer: a well-known pornography web site. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
## Answer
### Option 1: Help the client
#### Pros
- Helps your company fulfill their duties
- Will make both your company and the other company more profitable
- Makes the client less upset at your company
#### Cons
- Assisting a company that is not doing godly work and harming many people with their product.
- Will weigh on your consciousness that you are assisting an unethical company.
- Could affect the view that other clients have of your company.
#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Proverbs 14:23 - All hard work brings a profit, but mere talk leads only to poverty
__*Principle*__ - As an employee of this firm, you should be wanting to create as much prosperity for the firm as possible. 
#### Script
- Boss: Hey, one of our clients needs help troubleshooting their system, could you hop on a call and take care of it for me?
- Me: Yeah, sure thing, which client is it?
- Boss: It's the one in the adult film industry...
- Me: I'll have it off your desk by Tuesday, tops!

### Option 2: Have another employee take the client
#### Pros
- You do not have to take the job and the company still does what it needs to for it's client.
#### Cons
- Your company is still affiliated with the client and future work could be given to you.
- Your company could look down on you for refusing to do the work. 
- Your peer could not want to do the work either and this is placing the moral decision in his hands.
#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Colossians 3:23-24 - Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward
__*Principle*__ - Not being involved with the client could be seen as a form of "washing your hands" of the deed and that you want nothing to do with them, while offering to take other projects from a colleague to alleviate stress could be seen as helpful. 
#### Script
- Boss: Hey, one of our clients needs help troubleshooting their system, could you hop on a call and take care of it for me?
- Me: Yeah, sure thing, which client is it?
- Boss: It's the one in the adult film industry...
- Me: I don't feel super comfortable doing work for that client, could you see if Mike wants to take it instead? I'll take any projects he is working on right now!
- Boss: Yeah, I'll see if I can work that out!

### Option 3: Deny the client
#### Pros
- You don't have to be affiliated with the client. 
- You could use the time to work on other projects. 
#### Cons
- Turning down the work could mean losing your job.
- Could give your company a reputation for declining work. 
#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Ephesians 6:6 - Work hard, but not just to please your masters when they are watching. As slaves of Christ, do the will of God with all your heart
__*Principle*__ - As a believer you should know where the line is pertaining to what kind of of industries and ideals you are supporting. Even if the work falls on your company and it never comes back to you, sometimes drawing the line at even assisting companies like this is needed. 
#### Script
- Boss: Hey, one of our clients needs help troubleshooting their system, could you hop on a call and take care of it for me?
- Me: Yeah, sure thing, which client is it?
- Boss: It's the one in the adult film industry...
- Me: Sorry boss, I don't feel comfortable working for that client and I am going to have to turn that down. 
- Boss: You can do that?!?!

## Conclusion
As far as working at a credit card company would go, this would certainly be a foreseeable circumstance. Many companies have ethically questionable clients and will often not examine the moral outcomes of working with them. But as a believer we can approach the workplace with a sense of peace knowing that God's hand is moving within the world and has a plan in mind. If the company is large enough, they will have clients like this and sometimes there is no getting around the work given to you. 
## My Final Choice
My final choice would be option 2: seeing if there is a colleague that is willing to take the job. If the company is large enough to take a contract with a company in that industry, then there are probably people within the firm that would be more comfortable taking said client. I would not necessarily push the work off the table, I would just ask my supervisors if there was anyone else that would be willing to take this client over me.
