# Week 3 Ethics Response
## Question: 
While maintaining an extremely popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three responses? What do you do?

## Answers
### Option 1: Introduce the code/help the authorities
#### Pros
- You could assist in the arrest of criminals who are not doing good things, preventing this from happening in the future.
- You know that your code is doing good things in the world and not being misused. 
#### Cons
- People *could* see this as a reason to not use your open-source code (although this is a good enough reason to put backdoors in your code)
#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Titus 3:8 - This is a trustworthy saying. And I want you to stress these things, so that those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good. These things are excellent and profitable for everyone.
__*Principle*__ - Doing the right thing can be slippery slope sometimes, but in this situation it is quite obvious. Knowing that you can help bring people to justice because they are using public code is a positive output to have regarding your work. 
#### Script
- Authorities: Hey, heard you were the head of this open source project. We suspect there are people heading a human trafficking ring and they are using your repositories code. Can you implement a backdoor for us to get evidence to catch these criminals?
- You: Of course, I certainly can! Let me know if I can help in any other ways to apprehend these people!

### Option 2: Make them do it 
#### Pros
- Nothing gets tied back to you and you can remain anonymous.
- Your code can continue to be open source. 
#### Cons
- The authorities could see this as suspicious (why wouldn't you want to help them afterall?) 
#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Proverbs 4:14-19 - Don't take the path of the wicked; don't follow those who do evil. Stay away from that path; don't even go near it. Turn around and go another way. The wicked cannot sleep until they have done something evil.
__*Principle*__ - It's open source, the authorities can implement the code just as easy as you can. 
#### Script
- Authorities: Hey, heard you were the head of this open-source project. We suspect there are people heading a human trafficking ring and they are using your repositories code. Can you implement a backdoor for us to get evidence to catch these criminals?
- You: I'd rather not get involved, can you implement the code yourself?
- Authorities: Um... I guess so?

### Option 3: Deny the authorities access to your code
#### Pros
- There really isn't any pros, other than maintaining the privacy of those who use your repos.
#### Cons
- You could get arrested for assisting a criminal.
#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Galatians 5:13-14 - You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love. For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”
__*Principle*__ - We do have the freedom of choice and you could theoretically deny the authorities access to maintain that freedom for your users. 
#### Script
- Authorities: Hey, heard you were the head of this open-source project. We suspect there are people heading a human trafficking ring and they are using your repositories code. Can you implement a backdoor for us to get evidence to catch these criminals?
- You: No, I'd prefer that I didn't have backdoors in my code undermining my users and their freedom. You cannot access my repositories. 
- Authorities - Alright, we will be back with a warrant so we can use your code!

## Conclusion
This situation seems pretty one-sided. As far as freedom of access goes, the criminals are using a public repository and are taking a risk using open-source applications. And if this were myself, being a manager for an open-source repo like this, I would want it to serve the kingdom of God as best as it could and be used for ethical reasons. 

## My Final Choice
That is why I would take option and put a backdoor in for the authorities. I would also assist in any other way I could to apprehend these human traffickers.
