# Week 8 Ethics Assignment

Prompt: While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Possible Responses

### **Response 1: Tell Leadership that your Teammate is not Responsible for the Work**
- **Pros:** 
    - Keeps everybody informed on the true state of the team
    - Reflects honesty and openness to your superiors
    - Prevents other teammates from feeling that the situation is unfair
- **Cons:** 
    - Prevents your teammate from getting the raise
    - Could strain your relationship with the teammate
    - Causes division and strife among the team
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [manager], I heard that [teammate] was being considered for a raise because of his contribution to our last project. I'm happy for him but I thought you should know that he isn't responsible for most of what we got done. He's not catching on yet and I don't think he's ready for an advanced workload."
  - Manager: "Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We'll talk to him and reconsider."
- **Biblical Reference:** "The integrity of the upright guides them, but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity." Proverbs 11:3 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** This option is valid in the sense that it most closely conforms to an honest approach to the situation. Full disclosure is never objectively wrong and is quite possibly even the right way to deal with something like this. The downside is obviously the potential tension that could arise between you and the teammate, but picking this choice would indicate that honesty is the highest priority.
