# Week 5 Ethics Assignment

Prompt: You are a Computer Science professor at a local university teaching C Sharp to some very smart business students. In the second week of class, you spend an entire lecture with your students exhaustively talking about software plagiarism and copyright law with a Christian intellectual property attorney who makes it truly clear that taking code from another developer or site then calling it your own is not only legally wrong but morally wrong. In addition, your institution publishes the following policy:

>Plagiarism includes using someone else's data file as your own or representing the work of others as your own.

>The penalty for violating the academic integrity code is severe. Any student violating the academic integrity code may receive a failing grade for the course and will be reported. If a student is unclear about whether a particular situation may constitute an academic integrity violation, the student should meet with the instructor to discuss the situation.

>For this class, it is permissible to assist classmates in general discussions and such general advice and interaction is encouraged. Each person, however, must develop his or her own solutions to the assigned projects, assignments, and tasks. In other words, students may not "work together" on graded assignments unless specifically assigned to a group task by the course instructor. Such unauthorized collaboration would constitute cheating. A student may not use or copy (by any means) another's work (or portions of it) and represent it as his or her own.

Then this

Just a week or two into class, one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. Too good? You check and discover the code is identical to a C# tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. The writing is on the wall. But remember, you love this student: you don't want to overreact. But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: you don't want to underreact. A lot to think about. What do you do?

## Possible Responses

### <b>Response 1: Accept the Code and Give Partial Credit, Warn Student Moving Forward</b>

#### Pros-
Offers student the chance to learn without inflicting too harsh a punishment, gives warning signs early, sets clear expectations moving forward

#### Cons- 
Probably lets student off too easily, doesn't follow policy guidelines, gives partial credit for work that wasn't done by the student

#### Dialog- 
You: "Hey [Student], I noticed while grading your assignment this weekend that it was copied from an online tutorial."

Student: "Yes it was, I'm sorry for doing that. What happens now?"

You: "I'll accept the code this time and give you 25% credit, but make sure it doesn't happen again moving forward or else I won't be able to give any points."

Student: "Thank you, it won't happen again."

#### Biblical Reference- 
"Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you." -Colossians 3:13 (NIV)

#### First Principle- 
Someone could reasonably choose this action if he/she valued forgiveness above justice. Giving the student a firm warning along with a grade that provides some punishment without causing a ton of damage reflects a desire to see the student grow in an encouraging environment but also sets a clear boundary for the student to adhere to moving forward.

### <b>Response 2: Reject the Code but Offer Second Chance</b>

#### Pros- 
Gives the student the chance to earn the points fairly, doesn't accept plagiarized work, disincentivizes plagiarizing

#### Cons- 
Doesn't necessarily follow policy guidelines fully, could be seen as unfair by other students who didn't plagiarize

#### Dialog-
You: "Hey [Student], I noticed while grading your assignment this weekend that it was copied from an online tutorial."

Student: "Yes it was, I'm sorry for doing that. What happens now?"

You: "I can't accept this code as per the syllabus, but I am willing to offer you the chance to do it again in your own work and show me as you go if you want to earn those points back."

Student: "I'd be glad to try that, thanks for understanding."

#### Biblical Reference- 
"Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with their own hands, that they may have something to share with those in need." -Ephesians 4:28 (NIV)

#### First Principle- 
This option presents a good blend of firmness and forgiveness. It might technically not go by the exact letter of the plagiarism policy, but it demonstrates that you value the student as a person and understand that people make mistakes. This option opens the door for further instruction and guidance for the student without giving the student credit for work he/she did not do.

### <b>Response 3: Reject the Code Entirely, Give Zero Credit</b>

#### Pros- 
Follows the policy, heavily discourages future plagiarism, gives no credit for work that was not done by the student

#### Cons-
Could be seen as overly harsh, could discourage student too much very early in the semester, likely negatively impacts interpersonal relationship with student

#### Dialog-
You: "Hey [Student], I noticed while grading your assignment this weekend that it was copied from an online tutorial."

Student: "Yes it was, I'm sorry for doing that. What happens now?"

You: "I'm sorry, but I have to give you a zero on the assignment. Plagiarism isn't okay and I hope this serves as a good reminder for you moving forward."

#### Biblical Reference- 
"The Lord detests lying lips, but he delights in people who are trustworthy." -Proverbs 12:22

#### First Principle- 
Abiding by the letter of the law is always at least a safe bet, and in this case the letter of the law says to give the student a failing grade as a warning that plagiarism can't be tolerated. Effectively, this option follows the rules exactly how they should be followed. The student did not do the work and thus should not get the credit, and officially should not get another chance. This choice reflects all of this.

## My Choice
I would choose the second option, giving the student a second chance to do the assignment properly but giving no credit for the initial attempt. While it technically does not follow the policy exactly as it is outlined, I believe there is some level of human empathy that is displayed in option 2 and not in option 3. This is especially the case given that the scenario happened in week 2, very early in the course of the class. My opinion might be different if this happened late in the class after several weeks, but in this case it's likely one of the first interactions the student will ever have with you and thus I believe it's important to maintain a positive two-way relationship for good communication during the rest of the class.
