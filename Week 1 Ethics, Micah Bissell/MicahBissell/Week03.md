# Week 3 Ethics Assignment

Prompt: While maintaining an extremely popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three responses? What do you do?

## Possible Responses

<b>Response 1: Accept the Job, Don't Alert Anybody</b>

#### Pros- 
Gives best possible chance at stopping the child trafficking scheme, helps the authorities do their job, allows you to have a clear conscience about doing everything you can to help stop the scheme

#### Cons- 
Intentionally opens up vulnerabilities in the code, could compromise the future of the project, could be seen as dishonest to the project owner if ever found out

#### Dialog- 
Authorities: "We're trying to stop this child-trafficking scheme connected to the project. Can you contribute some code that lets us have more access to the other members?"

You: "Absolutely, I'll work on it now."

#### Biblical Reference- 
"Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them." -Ephesians 5:11, NIV

#### First Principle- 
It's easy to argue that the biggest concern in this situation is doing everything possible to stop the child trafficking scheme, even if it potentially comes at the cost of some of the security afforded to users of the project. When taking this approach, it is clearly the best idea to simply accept the job without question, don't tell anyone else about it, and let the authorities do their jobs. It is beyond your control to determine what they do with the access granted to them, but assuming that they have good motivations and high levels of competence is fair. Trust that the authorities will do good work with the access that you give them, and you can in good faith believe that you contributed positively.

<b>Response 2: Decline the Job</b>

#### Pros- 
Doesn't put anybody involved in the project at risk, keeps all personal information private, maintains your identity as a trustworthy developer

#### Cons- 
Doesn't do anything to solve the problem of child trafficking, does not help the authorities fulfill their obligations, doesn't necessarily reduce all risk anyways if authorities go through a different channel to achieve the same goal

#### Dialog-
Authorities: "We're trying to stop this child-trafficking scheme connected to the project. Can you contribute some code that lets us have more access to the other members?"

You: "I don't feel comfortable with putting everybody at risk that way, I'm sorry. Maybe try another developer?"

#### Biblical Reference- 
"The Lord detests dishonest scales, but accurate weights find favor with him." -Proverbs 11:1, NIV

#### First Principle- 
Choosing this option is effectively choosing not to engage. The problem was beyond your scope to begin with, so you have no reason to introduce yourself into it now. You understand that you can simultaneously understand that the child trafficking scheme is a terrible thing and also that it is out of your reasonable control, and so there's no need to enter a morally gray area of putting other users at risk just for the opportunity to help prevent the scheme. Choosing this route is not morally incorrect, it just doesn't take on any responsibility for the outcome, good or bad.

<b>Response 3: Accept the Job, Alert Owner</b>

#### Pros- 
Helps authorities, could prevent child trafficking, doesn't necessarily put people at risk given disclosure

#### Cons-
Could compromise integrity of the evidence, giving knowledge of the plan to more people could ruin the entire thing, the owner could step in and shut down the project instead of putting users at risk

#### Dialog-
Authorities: "We're trying to stop this child-trafficking scheme connected to the project. Can you contribute some code that lets us have more access to the other members?"

You: "I can do that, but I don't feel right about not telling the owner of the project what the plan is. I'll leave it up to him."

You: "Hey (owner), I just wanted to let you know that I'm planning to introduce some back door code to give more access to authorities so they can deal with some legal issues connected to the project."

Owner: "I'm not sure how comfortable I am with putting my other users at risk, but I'll think about it and get back to you."

#### Biblical Reference- 
"Whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out." Proverbs 10:9, NIV

#### First Principle- 
Choosing this route sort of combines the two others and creates a middle ground, but it is still its own distinct choice. To choose this path, one would have to believe that the child trafficking scheme is worth getting involved in and that it is worth more effort than the project users' security, but also that the users' security is still important and should not be compromised without serious thought and advance notice to relevant parties. Notifying the owner mitigates some of the potential damages to users, even if it doesn't fully prevent the damages. At the same time, however, this advance notice could compromise the integrity of what the authorities are trying to accomplish, so you would have to be careful about how much you disclose to the owner. This choice is all about finding a balance between how much you care about the child trafficking scheme and how much you care about protecting the users' security.

## My Choice
I would probably choose the first option, the option of simply accepting the project and not disclosing anything related to the code to any involved parties except the authorities. I genuinely believe that preventing the child trafficking scheme is far and away the highest priority here, and even if it doesn't give me full control over the situation, sending the authorities down the right track is the best I can do on my own. My own reputation as a developer may be in question if I am caught in the process of introducing the back door code, but to me that is a matter of less importance than the legal/moral battle at hand.
