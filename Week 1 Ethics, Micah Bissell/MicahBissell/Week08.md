# Week 8 Ethics Assignment

Prompt: While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Possible Responses

### **Response 1: Tell Leadership that your Teammate is not Responsible for the Work**
- **Pros:** 
    - Keeps everybody informed on the true state of the team
    - Reflects honesty and openness to your superiors
    - Prevents other teammates from feeling that the situation is unfair
- **Cons:** 
    - Prevents your teammate from getting the raise
    - Could strain your relationship with the teammate
    - Causes division and strife among the team
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [manager], I heard that [teammate] was being considered for a raise because of his contribution to our last project. I'm happy for him but I thought you should know that he isn't responsible for most of what we got done. He's not catching on yet and I don't think he's ready for an advanced workload."
  - Manager: "Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We'll talk to him and reconsider."
- **Biblical Reference:** "The integrity of the upright guides them, but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity." - Proverbs 11:3 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** This option is valid in the sense that it most closely conforms to an honest approach to the situation. Full disclosure is never objectively wrong and is quite possibly even the right way to deal with something like this. The downside is obviously the potential tension that could arise between you and the teammate, but picking this choice would indicate that honesty is the highest priority.

### **Response 2: Say Nothing, Let the Teammate get the Raise**
- **Pros:** 
    - Makes the teammate happy
    - Avoids confrontation
    - Keeps team intact and working towards the same goals as before
- **Cons:** 
    - Misleads management on the teammate's actual capabilities
    - Might cause the rest of the team to feel that the raise is unfair
    - Doesn't incentivize the teammate to work harder
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [teammate], I heard you were up for a raise. Congrats!"
  - Teammate: "Thanks, I appreciate it!"
- **Biblical Reference:** "A person’s wisdom yields patience; it is to one’s glory to overlook an offense." - Proverbs 19:11 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** Allowing the teammate to just take the raise might seem slightly dishonest, but in reality just overlooking any perceived wrongdoing and understanding that you may not have the full picture is valuable. This allows you to be a peacekeeper and develop patience, as well as just be happy for your friend who is likely going to be really happy about his raise.

### **Response 3: Talk to the Teammate Privately, Ecourage him to be Open with Management**
- **Pros:** 
    - Lets the teammate know about the situation
    - Lets you share the weight of the decision with the person it would affect the most, your teammate
    - Could allow for you to get closer to the teammate personally
- **Cons:** 
    - Might not lead to him disclosing the situation
    - Teammate could react defensively, causing division
    - Would be a challenging conversation to approach directly
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [teammate], I heard you were up for a raise. I'm happy for you, but I'd ask why you think you're getting one? Respectfully, we both know that you haven't been catching on as well yet, and that's okay, but let's keep working at the level you're on before you move on to something bigger."
  - Teammate: "You're right honestly, I probably don't deserve the raise yet. Let's keep working and hopefully I'll get to the point where I deserve it soon."
- **Biblical Reference:** "Better is open rebuke than hidden love. Wounds from a friend can be trusted, but an enemy multiplies kisses." - Proverbs 27:5-6 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** This option allows for more open communication between you and your teammate, and if that's the most valuable thing for you, this is what you would choose. The other options leave him in the dark about a situation that matters a lot to him, but this one removes that barrier and brings him into the loop. It also gives him some of the decision-making power as opposed to deciding his fate for him.

## My Choice
I would choose the third option, talking to the teammate privately and encouraging him to be open about his shortcomings with management. I don't feel comfortable actively trying to tear down his accomplishments for the purpose of not allowing him to get a raise, and saying nothing feels like lying by omission. Talking to the teammate in private allows him to make his own decision based on what has been placed on his heart, which feels better and more loving to me than the other two possibilities.
