# Week 6 Ethics Assignment

Prompt from Week 4: While working on a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three responses? What do you do?

## Possible Responses

<b>Response 1: Gabe's Choice- Offer to Take on Some Workload</b>

#### Pros-
- Shows empathy for your coworker
- Helps relieve them of some of their duties, leading to improved mental condition
- Builds trust with the entire team

#### Cons- 
- Could be a shallow or incomplete response to your teammate's struggles
- Takes more responsibility on yourself, leading to decreased productivity
- Teammate could refuse the help

<b>Response 2: Diego's Choice- Provide the Worker with Needed Resources, Including Time off if Needed</b>

#### Pros- 
- Provides a path to better mental health
- Won't cause too much delay in the project relative to just giving him full time off
- Builds a positive work culture within the company, proving that they care for their employees

#### Cons- 
- Uses company resources that weren't being used before
- Might delay the project some if he does end up taking time off
- Company might not be willing to provide the resources he asks for/needs

## My Choice
I would lean towards Diego's choice. His option keeps the teammate working on his tasks without much pressure, which reduces the risk of delaying the project while still leading him towards better mental health. Gabe's option would help, it just wouldn't be as efficient and could run some risks for your own productivity.
