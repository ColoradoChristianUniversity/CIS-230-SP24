# Week 2 Ethics Assignment

Prompt: While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Possible Responses

<b>Response 1: Accept the Job Fully</b>

#### Pros-
Fulfills contractual obligations, improves efficiency for your customer, grows relationship between the two parties

#### Cons- 
Pins responsibility for laying workers off on you, causes guilt, could be seen as supporting an unethical company/customer

#### Dialog- 
Customer: "Hey, can you guys help me with this machine learning project? I'm looking to cut down on my expenses and this might help grow my business faster than human employment has so far."

You: "Definitely, we'll start work on it right away."

#### Biblical Reference- 
"Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the realm of the dead, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom." -Ecclesiastes 9:10

#### First Principle- 
There is value to be had from just doing the work that is assigned to you, regardless of what you believe the consequences might be. A Christian could choose this path in good faith, believing that God's will for some or all of the people potentially being fired is something greater than what they were in before.

<b>Response 2: Decline the Job</b>

#### Pros- 
Avoids the responsibility of being the one to cause 175 people to lose their jobs, does not support unethical use of technology

#### Cons- 
Goes directly against contractual obligations, could result in you getting fired, definitely sours relationship between the customer and the Consultancy

#### Dialog-
Customer: "Hey, can you guys help me with this machine learning project? I'm looking to cut down on my expenses and this might help grow my business faster than human employment has so far."

You: "Sorry but I'm not sure I can help with that in good faith, knowing the consequences. I can't accept the job."

Customer: "I'll take my project to someone else then. Can I speak to your boss?"

You: "Certainly, I'll get you two connected."

#### Biblical Reference- 
"Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others." -Philippians 2:4

#### First Principle- 
If an employee believes that preserving others' livelihoods is a hard moral line that shouldn't be crossed, which is a valid and respectable opinion, then that employee should stand with his own morals above all else, even his own job security. Working in an environment where morals of that strength are not respected is not a positive influence regardless, so even if declining a task does result in getting fired, it's not necessarily the worst possible outcome in the grand scheme of things.

<b>Response 3: Ask to Work with the Customer Directly to Improve Efficiency Without Losing Employees</b>

#### Pros- 
Displays thoughtfulness beyond blind commitment, possibly allows for some middle ground that improves efficiency without the need to lay off the workers

#### Cons-
Could result in delays in the progress of the project, could sour relationship with the customer if not doing exactly what was requested, gives yourself significantly more responsibility than before

#### Dialog-
Customer: "Hey, can you guys help me with this machine learning project? I'm looking to cut down on my expenses and this might help grow my business faster than human employment has so far."

You: "Is there any way we could develop this project in a way that still improves your efficiency without sacrificing your human workforce?"

Customer: "I hadn't really thought about that option and I'm not sure I'm willing to keep all of the salaries I've been paying, but we can try. Let's see what we can work out."

#### Biblical Reference- 
"For lack of guidance a nation falls, but victory is won through many advisers." -Proverbs 11:14

#### First Principle- 
This option demonstrates an understanding of the customer's position and potential outcomes without being inflammatory or too passive. It also shows both the customer and your own company that you are willing to put in work to achieve the most desirable outcome, regardless of what it might take by way of sacrificing personal time and other resources.

## My Choice
Given all three of these choices, I would lean towards option 3 with a slight bias towards declining the job altogether. If the customer is unwilling to work with me after I propose the third option, I would outright decline the job. Being the direct cause of anybody losing their job, let alone 175 people, is not worthwhile to me. There is value in trying to mediate between two extremes, but I can't personally see any circumstances where I would accept the job as it is being requested by the customer.
