# Week 4 Ethics Assignment

Prompt: While working on a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three responses? What do you do?

## Possible Responses

<b>Response 1: Offer to Take on his Responsibilities</b>

#### Pros-
Allows the teammate to take a break from the stress, give him the opportunity to get help with his relaxed load, keeps customer

#### Cons- 
Could overwhelm you, doesn't give the teammate a long term solution, could result in loss of the customer if you can't keep up with increased workload

#### Dialog- 
Teammate: "Hey, I'm struggling quite a bit right now- any chance you could help me out?"

You: "Yeah for sure, let me talk to the rest of the team and I'll see if I can pick up your slack. Get yourself some help and come back when you're ready."

#### Biblical Reference- 
"Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ." -Galatians 6:2 (NIV)

#### First Principle- 
If someone values empathy and servitude highly, then this is likely the best option for that person. Helping protect another person's livelihood and his/her mental health is valuable and is easily defensible as the best option.

<b>Response 2: Just Continue with Job, Don't Accept More Work</b>

#### Pros- 
Doesn't take on any new responsibility, hopefully keeps the project moving forward

#### Cons- 
Insensitive to teammate, likely leads to decreased production on his part, could lead to not finishing the project and ruining relationship with customer

#### Dialog-
Teammate: "Hey, I'm struggling quite a bit right now- any chance you could help me out?"

You: "I'm sorry, I don't really think I can take any more work on for this project. I'd love to help but I can't right now."

#### Biblical Reference- 
"As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another." -Proverbs 27:17 (NIV)

#### First Principle- 
While this option may be extremely insensitive, it's not necessarily sinful or wrong at all to simply continue carrying your own workload. Expressing compassion doesn't necessarily have to look like taking on new responsibilities- it would be possible in this situation to not accept more work and still be compassionate toward him by spending time with him and directing him to resources where he can get help.

<b>Response 3: Ask to Divide Responsibility Among the Rest of the Team</b>

#### Pros- 
Protects relationship with customer, gets the job done, doesn't give any single person too much work

#### Cons-
Could reduce efficiency individually and team-wide, likely relies on the teammate being willing to share his struggles with the entire team

#### Dialog-
Teammate: "Hey, I'm struggling quite a bit right now- any chance you could help me out?"

You: "Let's talk to the rest of the team about it if you're comfortable. I think we can pick up your slack if you're willing to let them know what you're going through."

#### Biblical Reference- 
"Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up." -Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 (NIV)

#### First Principle- 
Bringing the entire team in on the one teammate's struggles might be intimidating at first, but it could lead to a long-term solution for the teammate. In addition to this, this option gets the project done without losing much efficiency. Overall, this option represents an empathetic approach to the teammate's mental health issues without sacrificing the project.

## My Choice
I would easily lean towards at least encouraging the third option, trying to spread the teammate's work across the rest of the team. It does rely on cooperation and willingness to be vulnerable from the teammate himself, but it likely leads to the best possible outcome for both the teammate and the project.
