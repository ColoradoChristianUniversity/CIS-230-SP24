# Week 5 Ethics Assignment

## Prompt
A junior engineer at your company, leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence, has completed a critical software project well ahead of schedule. The AI has written almost the entire application, raising questions about the engineer's understanding of the project's intricacies. Despite this, the company's management, impressed by the speedy delivery, is planning to integrate this AI-generated software into major systems immediately. You are concerned but you are also friends with this junior developer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Possible Responses

### **Response 1: Tell Management that the Code was Written by AI, not the Junior Engineer**
- **Pros:** 
    - Keeps your friend on work that he is capable of completing
    - Reflects honesty and openness to your superiors
    - Gives your friend the chance to continue learning at his actual production level
- **Cons:** 
    - Could be seen as a compromise of trust between you and your friend
    - Takes away his credit, possibly leading him to react negatively
    - Could lead management to punish your friend for not understanding his application
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Excuse me [manager], but you know that recent project submitted by [engineer]?"
  - Manager: "Yes I do, what about it?"
  - You: "He wrote it all using AI. I hate to throw him under the bus but I don't think he can handle the higher responsibilities that he'll be given if you don't know about the AI."
  - Manager: "Thanks for letting me know. I'll talk with him."
- **Biblical Reference:** "Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue lasts only a moment." - Proverbs 12:19 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** This is a valid choice if you are willing to risk sacrificing the relationship with the friend, in part because it helps that friend in the long run more than not exposing his actions. The friend might not appreciate this choice in the moment, but it was made with the greater good- long-term preservation of his job- in mind rather than short-term benefits with a high risk of implosion.

### **Response 2: Privately Tutor the Junior Engineer so he can Accept the Impending Challenging Tasks**
- **Pros:** 
    - Prepares your friend for the increased workload that he will inevitably face
    - Actively sets your friend up for future success, beyond the scope of just the upcoming projects
    - Gives you the opportunity to spend time one on one with the friend and get to know his thought process better
- **Cons:** 
    - Takes away from your own personal time, possibly leading to decreased efficiency on your part
    - Potentially not a fast enough solution depending on how much your friend knows going in
    - Runs the risk of your friend simply repeating his mistake if he views your tutoring offer as being lenient
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [engineer], I know you used AI on that last project and I don't think you're ready for what they're going to throw at you now."
  - Engineer: "What can I do about it?"
  - You: "I'm willing to spend some time with you one on one to go over what your application does if you're willing to be tutored."
  - Engineer: "Thanks for the offer, I'd love to try that. I'm willing to put in whatever if takes for me to get caught up in time."
- **Biblical Reference:** "Let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance." - Proverbs 1:5 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** Choosing to tutor your friend is a good option because it not only lets you keep your relationship with him in good standing, but also opens the door for improvement in that respect. This solution, if it works, is a good way to show your friend that you care for him/her as an individual, because it demonstrates a sense of self-sacrifice for his/her greater good.

### **Response 3: Say Nothing to Management but Warn Junior Engineer of Upcoming Increased Responsibilities**
- **Pros:** 
    - Mentally prepares your friend for the increased workload that he will inevitably face
    - Doesn't cause you to lose any personal efficiency
    - Shows your friend that you're at least thinking about him and his career
- **Cons:** 
    - Does nothing to practically alleviate/slow the oncoming situation
    - Might not convey the true severity of the problem to your friend
    - Could risk your friend being frustrated with your lack of effort if he can't handle new responsibilities
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [engineer], I know you used AI on that last project and I don't think you're ready for what they're going to throw at you now."
  - Engineer: "What can I do about it?"
  - You: "I don't really know if there's anything you can do, just be ready if they start putting you on assignments that you aren't ready for yet."
  - Engineer: "Thanks for letting me know, at least."
- **Biblical Reference:** "Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to act." - Proverbs 3:27 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** This is a fine option if you aren't in a good spot to be able to help in a more practical way. It lets your friend know of the upcoming challenges that he might not be prepared for without belittling his abilities or capacities by telling management that he can't do something. This allows him to work on his problems on his own time, which might not be the most efficient practical solution, but does still get him closer to his goal of being able to tackle the new assignments.


## My Choice
I would choose the second option, tutoring the junior engineer and trying to get him ready to not only understand and explain the code he already submitted, but to take on new projects with his perceived advanced capabilities. This option gives him the highest chance of keeping his job, and also actively boosts his capabilities so he can move forward as a more valuable part of the team.
