# Week 5 Ethics Assignment

## Prompt
A junior engineer at your company, leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence, has completed a critical software project well ahead of schedule. The AI has written almost the entire application, raising questions about the engineer's understanding of the project's intricacies. Despite this, the company's management, impressed by the speedy delivery, is planning to integrate this AI-generated software into major systems immediately. You are concerned but you are also friends with this junior developer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Possible Responses

### **Response 1: Tell Management that the Code was Written by AI, not the Junior Engineer**
- **Pros:** 
    - Keeps your friend on work that he is capable of completing
    - Reflects honesty and openness to your superiors
    - Gives your friend the chance to continue learning at his actual production level
- **Cons:** 
    - Could be seen as a compromise of trust between you and your friend
    - Takes away his credit, possibly leading him to react negatively
    - Could lead management to punish your friend for not understanding his application
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Excuse me [manager], but you know that recent project submitted by [engineer]?"
  - Manager: "Yes I do, what about it?"
  - You: "He wrote it all using AI. I hate to throw him under the bus but I don't think he can handle the higher responsibilities that he'll be given if you don't know about the AI."
  - Manager: "Thanks for letting me know. I'll talk with him."
- **Biblical Reference:** "Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue lasts only a moment." - Proverbs 12:19 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** This is a valid choice if you are willing to risk sacrificing the relationship with the friend, in part because it helps that friend in the long run more than not exposing his actions. The friend might not appreciate this choice in the moment, but it was made with the greater good- long-term preservation of his job- in mind rather than short-term benefits with a high risk of implosion.


## My Choice
I would choose the second option, giving the student a second chance to do the assignment properly but giving no credit for the initial attempt. While it technically does not follow the policy exactly as it is outlined, I believe there is some level of human empathy that is displayed in option 2 and not in option 3. This is especially the case given that the scenario happened in week 2, very early in the course of the class. My opinion might be different if this happened late in the class after several weeks, but in this case it's likely one of the first interactions the student will ever have with you and thus I believe it's important to maintain a positive two-way relationship for good communication during the rest of the class.
