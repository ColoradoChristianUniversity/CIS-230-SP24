# Week05 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> Situation setup:\
> You are a Computer Science professor at a local university teaching C Sharp to some very smart business students. In the second week of class, you spend an entire lecture with your students exhaustively talking about software plagiarism and copyright law with a Christian intellectual property attorney who makes it truly clear that taking code from another developer or site then calling it your own is not only legally wrong but morally wrong. In addition, your institution publishes the following policy:
    
    Plagiarism includes using someone else's data file as your own or representing the work of others as your own.
    The penalty for violating the academic integrity code is severe. Any student violating the academic integrity code may receive a failing grade for the course and will be reported. If a student is unclear about whether a particular situation may constitute an academic integrity violation, the student should meet with the instructor to discuss the situation.
    For this class, it is permissible to assist classmates in general discussions and such general advice and interaction is encouraged. Each person, however, must develop his or her own solutions to the assigned projects, assignments, and tasks. In other words, students may not "work together" on graded assignments unless specifically assigned to a group task by the course instructor. Such unauthorized collaboration would constitute cheating. A student may not use or copy (by any means) another's work (or portions of it) and represent it as his or her own.

> Then this:\
> Just a week or two into class, one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. Too good? You check and discover the code is identical to a C# tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. The writing is on the wall. But remember, you love this student: you don't want to overreact. But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: you don't want to underreact. A lot to think about. What do you do?
## Option 1: _Speak with the student privately_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Avoids unwanted publicity of the incident.
> * Allows for the possibility that there is some mistake.
> * Gives the student another chance to repent.

❌ __Cons:__
> * Probably does not follow the university's policies on how to handle plagiarism.
> * Could allow the student to be manipulative and get away with unrepentant sin.
> * Will still result in an awkward conversation.

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ _(After class)_ Hey, {student}! Do you have a couple minutes to talk?\
> ___Student:___ Sure, what is it, Professor?\
> ___Me:___ I really hate to have to have this conversation, but I know you cheated on the assignment and plagiarized from an online source.
> ___Student:___ _(Sweating)_ Uhhh...what do you mean?
> ___Me:___ Your code perfectly matches a C# tutorial--\
> ___Student:___ Alright, I did it! I'm so sorry, I just got overwhelmed, and I didn't know what to do! But I know it was wrong. I never should have done it.\
> ___Me:___ Well, you are very right, you never should have done it. I will have to think about what steps we will take moving forward.

✝ __Scripture:__
> Matthew 15:18 (ESV): "If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother."

☝ __First Principle:__
> It is generally best to try to understand the situation before making judgment calls or decisions that could drastically impact someone's life.

## Option 2: _Report the student, and follow the institution's procedure_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Avoids any possibility of me, the professor, getting in trouble.
> * Follows through on the warnings made before.
> * Avoids the appearance of favoritism if another student needs to be punished for plagiarism in the future.

❌ __Cons:__
> * Does not account for the possibility of a mistake.
> * Gives no room for grace.
> * Could bring bad publicity to your class and even your university.

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ _(To student)_ It pains me to have to say this, but I know you copied a C# tutorial and submitted it as your own work. As I iterated in class, that is a form of plagiarism.\
> ___Student:___ What is going to happen to me?\
> ___Me:___ We are going to follow the steps outlined by the university. I will have to report this, and depending on what is decided, you may receive a failing grade in this class, or possibly even be expelled. This is very serious.\
> ___Student:___ *\*Cries\**

✝ __Scripture:__
> Psalm 106:3 (ESV): "Blessed are they who observe justice, who do righteousness at all times!"

☝ __First Principle:__
> There are rules in the university that must be followed, and I cannot let my feelings or desires to help my students get in the way of what's right. If a student cheats, then they must face the consequences. It will also teach them responsibility for the future.

## Option 3: _Tell the class that you know someone cheated, and give them a chance to confess_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Allows for personal repentance and responsibility.
> * Will discourage any others from cheating, since they know they'll be caught.
> * .

❌ __Cons:__
> * Does not necessarily follow the university's guidelines.
> * Could end up only postponing the inevitable if the student does not confess.
> * Could make me appear weak by not following through on my warnings right away.

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ _(To the class)_ I have some very disappointing, unfortunate, and serious news to tell you all. A lot of you did a very great job on this assignment, and I'm proud of you. However, someone thought they could be very clever and copy a C# tutorial, passing it off as their own work. As I have said many times before, very clearly, this is a form of plagiarism, and it is very serious. I am not calling out any names right now, but you know who you are. I will give this student a chance to confess their guilt to me before I have to report the situation. Come speak with me after class, and we will discuss next steps.\
> ___Students:___ Oooooooooooohhhhhhh

✝ __Scripture:__
> Galatians 6:1 (ESV): "Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted."

☝ __First Principle:__
> People will make irresponsible decisions, especially young people. And while they must face the consequences of their decisions, it is the responsibility of the more mature to help guide them and give them grace when appropriate.

## 🏁 Conclusion:
> The main consideration in this problem is grace versus justice. I could simply report the student and give them a zero in the class and possibly get them expelled, and I would be perfectly justified. However, I care about my students, and I want them to succeed longterm. Therefore, I have to decide how much grace is too much, and where the line should be drawn between helping the student recover from their mistake and letting them feel the consequences. I also have to take into consideration the morality of following or defying the university's policies on the matter.

## ✨Personal Choice:
> As for me, I would choose option 1: speaking privately with the student. This allows for the most flexibility in my approach. If there is some misunderstanding, and somehow the student did not plagiarize, then I have kept things under wraps and there will be no collateral damage. But if the student has indeed plagiarized, then I can decide what further steps I would like to take based on how the student responds to the confrontation.
