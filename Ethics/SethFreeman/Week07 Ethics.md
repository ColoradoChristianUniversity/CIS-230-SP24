# Week04 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> A junior engineer at your company, leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence, has completed a critical software project well ahead of schedule. The AI has written almost the entire application, raising questions about the engineer's understanding of the project's intricacies. Despite this, the company's management, impressed by the speedy delivery, is planning to integrate this AI-generated software into major systems immediately. You are concerned but you are also friends with this junior developer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
## Option 1: _Speak with the management_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Could prevent potential integration disaster.
> * Takes the problem directly to the people who are responsible for it.
> * Could elevate me in managements' eyes for thwarting a risk.

❌ __Cons:__
> * Ignores my relationship with this engineer.
> * Could possibly be sticking my nose in where it doesn't belong.
> * Could make me look stupid if the developer does know what he is doing.

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ I have a concern that I would like to bring to your attion. I noticed that the developer who worked on this software project utilized a lot of AI, more than anyone expected. In addition, he is only a junior developer. I have not seen many good signs that he understands all of the code that the AI wrote for him, and I am concerned that there may be unforseen consequences to immediately integrating this code.\
> ___Management:___ Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We will look into it and take appropriate action.\

✝ __Scripture:__
> Titus 3:1: "Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work."

☝ __First Principle:__
> It is best to take the situation to the people who are responsible for the decisions. They will ultimately make the call of whether or not the code is safe to use, so they should be the ones informed.

## Option 2: _Speak with the developer_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Keeps the issue quiet in case he does understand the code.
> * Allows the developer to decide how they want to handle the issue according to their conscience.
> * Provides an opportunity to get to know this engineer better.

❌ __Cons:__
> * Might not stop management from integrating the software soon enough.
> * Could possibly damage my relationship with this engineer by coming off as judgmental.
> * Will still leave me in a predicament if the engineer doesn't understand the code, but won't confess to management.
📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ Hey, John, can I talk with you for a minute?\
> ___Developer:___ Sure, what's up?\
> ___Me:___ I noticed that the vast majority of the code in your project was written entirely by AI. Don't take this the wrong way, but I just wanted to ask, did you make sure to run through all of it, make sure you know exactly what it is doing, and fix any potential bugs?\
> ___Developer:___ Uh...yeah! Of course! Why wouldn't I?...?\
> ___Me:___ (*Glares*)\
> ___Developer:___ Okay, you got me. I should have been more thorough. I guess I will have to recall the code for a little more testing, if possible...\

✝ __Scripture:__
> Matthew 5:25 (ESV): "Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison."

☝ __First Principle:__
> It is best to start with the simplest solution, then escalate the situation if it doesn't work. This developer is responsible for their own code, so they should be the ones to confess if they don't know what it does. Besides, I can always escalate the problem to management afterwards if I need to.

## Option 3: _Spread rumors about the risks_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Makes me more anonymous in the equation.
> * Could possibly cause the developer himself to reconsider.
> * Could incite others to confront the engineer.

❌ __Cons:__
> * Is a bit deceptive and gossipy.
> * Has no guarantee that any action will be taken for the better.
> * Is the coward's way out.

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ (*Whispering*) Hey, Jacob! Did you hear about John's software project delivery? He got it done way ahead of schedule!\
> ___Jacob:___ Yeah, crazy, right?\
> ___Me:___ However, I heard around that he used AI almost entirely to write it, and that he doesn't really understand what it does. What if there is some bug that AI didn't catch that he didn't even look over?\
> ___Jacob:___ Hmmm good point. That would be a problem!

✝ __Scripture:__
> Proverbs 11:14 (ESV): "Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety."

☝ __First Principle:__
> There is a higher likelihood that my concern will be heard and met with if many people know about it and are worried about it with me. While management might not even listen to me alone, the concerns of a dozen developers will likely turn their ear. Also, the original developer might feel greater pressure to come clean if many people are asking him about his knowledge of the code.

## 🏁 Conclusion:
> This situation is somewhat like some of the other ones we have done. The main conflict comes from how much I should be involved, and who is responsible for handling the potential issue. Both relationships and the company's future are on the line, and I have to balance my approach to not completely forsake either one.

## ✨Personal Choice:
> Personally, I would probably choose option 2, speaking with the developer. I think this would be a good first step, cracking open the door and getting a feel for if my concerns are even justified. After I do this, I could move on to further steps if necessary, or simply let the developer handle it. Plus, this method would show this person that I care about them individually, and I am not simply going to tattle on them to mangament if we can handle things one-on-one.
