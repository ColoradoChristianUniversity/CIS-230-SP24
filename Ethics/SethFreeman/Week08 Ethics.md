# Week08 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
## Option 1: _Say nothing_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Avoids conflict
> * Allows the teammate's inadequacy to reveal itself with time
> * Doesn't damage any relationships, either with management or the teammate

❌ __Cons:__
> * Could damage the company by allowing an underqualified employee to run things they shouldn't
> * Could result in the teammate getting fired
> * Does nothing to acknowledge the fact that I probably earned the promotion instead of the teammate

## Option 2: _Speak to the teammate about it_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Could prompt the teammate to confess their inadequacy to management
> * Could possibly result in me getting the credit for the work I did
> * Takes care of the problem while not self-advertizing to management

❌ __Cons:__
> * Could damage my relationship with the teammate, depending on how they take it
> * Leaves the situation in the hands of the person who would benefit most from lying about it
> * Could leave management still unaware of my good performance, depending on what the teammate says

## Option 3: _Explain your concerns to management_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Takes the issue to the people more concerned for the good of the company
> * Allows me to present the situation in a balanced way that doesn't come across as self-promoting or attacking my teammate
> * Shows confidence, initiative, and care for the company to management, if I present it properly

❌ __Cons:__
> * Could make my teammate feel betrayed
> * If I don't present it properly, it could make management think I am just boasting about myself or attacking a teammate
> * Puts myself in the thick of the situation where it would thereafter be difficult to extract myself if things didn't go well
