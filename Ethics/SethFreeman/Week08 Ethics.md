# Week08 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
## Option 1: _Say nothing_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Avoids conflict
> * Allows the teammate's inadequacy to reveal itself with time
> * Doesn't damage any relationships, either with management or the teammate

❌ __Cons:__
> * Could damage the company by allowing an underqualified employee to run things they shouldn't
> * Could result in the teammate getting fired
> * Does nothing to acknowledge the fact that I probably earned the promotion instead of the teammate

📜 __Script:__
> ___Management:___ Before we go, we would like to make an important announcement. We have noticed John's exceptional performance recently, and we have decided to reward this by promoting him to a leadership position. John, thank you for your great contributions to this company.\
> ___John:___ ...Oh, of course!! ...Always a pleasure!!\
> ___Me:___ ............\

✝ __Scripture:__
> Luke 12:2-3 (ESV): "Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. Therefore whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in private rooms shall be proclaimed on the housetops."

☝ __First Principle:__
> In situations like this, it may be best to let things play themselves out. If the teammate is not ready for the position, it will quickly become manifest. But if they are somehow adequate, then saying something would make me look like a fool.

## Option 2: _Speak to the teammate about it_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Could prompt the teammate to confess their inadequacy to management
> * Could possibly result in me getting the credit for the work I did
> * Takes care of the problem while not self-advertising to management

❌ __Cons:__
> * Could damage my relationship with the teammate, depending on how they take it
> * Leaves the situation in the hands of the person who would benefit most from lying about it
> * Could leave management still unaware of my good performance, depending on what the teammate says

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ Hey, John, can I speak to you for a minute? Look, I hate to bring this up, but I just want to do what's right for the company and make sure we are on the same page. I heard about your promotion to leadership. Don't get me wrong, I think you're a great guy, but do you honestly feel prepared to take this position? It looks to me like management has attributed our combined work solely to you, and this is why they are giving you the promotion. This is ultimately up to your conscience, but unless you honestly think that you can continue to perform at that level without me, I would recommend explaining the situation to management. I know it might be embarrassing, but I think it's for the good of the company, and it could save you a lot of headache (and possibly your job) later on.\
> ___John:___ Hmph. I'll think about it.\

✝ __Scripture:__
> Luke 17:3 (ESV): "Pay attention to yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him,"

☝ __First Principle:__
> By explaining my view on the situation to the teammate, I show my concern for both the company and for him personally. It is always better for the person who is being falsely promoted to make the correction themselves. That way, they look humble, and I don't look arrogant.

## Option 3: _Explain your concerns to management_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Takes the issue to the people more concerned for the good of the company
> * Allows me to present the situation in a balanced way that doesn't come across as self-promoting or attacking my teammate
> * Shows confidence, initiative, and care for the company to management, if I present it properly

❌ __Cons:__
> * Could make my teammate feel betrayed
> * If I don't present it properly, it could make management think I am just boasting about myself or attacking a teammate
> * Puts myself in the thick of the situation where it would thereafter be difficult to extract myself if things didn't go well

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ Hello, can I speak with you for just a minute? I have a concern that I would like to bring to your attention. I am not sure if you are already aware of this, but all of John's recent work has been a collaboration between him and me. I don't mean to degrade him in the slightest, but to be honest, the majority of our recent releases has been completed by me. I have been mentoring him for the last six months, and I have some concerns about his readiness to take this leadership position. I just thought to make you aware of this, if you didn't already know. Thank you for your time!\
> ___Management:___ I was not aware of that, so thank you for bringing it up. I will speak with him as soon as I get the chance.\

✝ __Scripture:__
> Ephesians 5:11 (ESV): "Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them."

☝ __First Principle:__
> The only way to be sure that the situation is taken care of properly is to address it to those in charge of the faulty promotion. They made the mistake, so they should be the ones to redress it. I cannot be sure that the teammate or anyone else will adequately explain the situation to management, so doing it myself ensures that the proper message is given.

## 🏁 Conclusion:
> The tension in this situation comes from the fact that, if I don't address the situation, it could damage the company and the teammate both. However, if I do, it could look like I am self-promoting, reflecting poorly on my character to management. The different ways I can address the situation balance these two risks inversely. The less my approach risks in the area of damage to the company, the more personal risk it takes on, and vice versa. Therefore, no matter what I choose, there is always risk. I simply must decide how much of that risk I want to take on myself.

## ✨Personal Choice:
> Given these options, I would choose option 2: speaking to the teammate about it. Similar to other ethics prompts, this approach gives me the greatest variety in how I move forward. If the teammate responds well, then I have kept my relationship with them and resolved the situation. But if they do not, I can always fall on a backup plan, like speaking to management. It allows me to take things slowly and not stick myself farther into the situation than I can retreat from if necessary.
