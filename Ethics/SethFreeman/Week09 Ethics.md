# Week04 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> While writing some code Saturday night, you realize you have introduced a crippling bug that breaks the entire system. As a Christian, you have politely requested no deadlines, meetings or work ever occur on Sunday. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Option 1: _Inform someone of the bug_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. Maintains my stance on Sundays | 1. Puts the burden of my mistake on someone else |
| 2. Allows the problem to possibly be fixed | 2. Still requires me to contact other people, which could be considered a "meeting" |
| 3. At least acknowledges my mistake | 3.  |

## Option 2: _Ask for Monday off instead_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. Takes personal responsibility for the solution | 1. Violates my Sunday policy |
| 2. Keeps a day of rest | 2. Eliminates an entire day of productivity on Monday |
| 3. Shows a willingness to put aside personal needs for the company | 3. Shows my boss that I will compromise my policies, if put under enough pressure |

## Option 3: _Fix the bug, working for the Lord_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. Necessitates reliance on the Lord | 1. Possibly violates my commitment to the Lord (Is this my Sabbath? Unclear.) |
| 2. Acknowledges that I work for God, not man | 2. Such willingness could cause my boss to require similar Sunday compomises in the future |
| 3. Takes full responsibility for the situation | 3. Gives me no mental, spiritual, or relational break, possibly leading to burnout |
