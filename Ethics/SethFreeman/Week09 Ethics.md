# Week04 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> While writing some code Saturday night, you realize you have introduced a crippling bug that breaks the entire system. As a Christian, you have politely requested no deadlines, meetings or work ever occur on Sunday. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Option 1: _Inform someone of the bug_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. Maintains my stance on Sundays | 1. Puts the burden of my mistake on someone else |
| 2. Allows the problem to possibly be fixed | 2. Still requires me to contact other people, which could be considered a "meeting" |
| 3. At least acknowledges my mistake | 3. Could result in losing my job, if I don't take further action |


📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ Hey, boss, can I talk to you for a minute? I just realized that I made a huge mistake. While writing this code, I created a bug that is rendering the system non-functional. Since I won't be able to come in to work tomorrow, I wanted to let you know right away. I can point out what I did that caused it, and how I think it could be fixed, and if there are still issues on Monday morning, I promise, I will be the first one in to work on it.\
> ___Boss:___ We will have to talk more about this later. For now, just work on getting the thing fixed, and I'll round up a team to cover your butt.

✝ __Scripture:__
> Exodus 31:14 (ESV): "You shall keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you...Whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people."

☝ __First Principle:__
> My commitment to God has to always come first. While I am responsible for my job, and of course I should do everything I can to make up for my mistake, I can never let earthly things get in the way of my walk with the Lord.

## Option 2: _Ask for Monday off instead_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. Takes personal responsibility for the solution | 1. Violates my Sunday policy |
| 2. Keeps a day of rest | 2. Eliminates an entire day of productivity on Monday |
| 3. Shows a willingness to put aside personal needs for the company | 3. Shows my boss that I will compromise my policies, if put under enough pressure |

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ Hey, boss, I messed up big time. I was trying to fix part of the code, but I accidentally introduced a huge bug that broke the system. I know it's critical that we get this fixed right away, so I am going to take responsibility for it and make this one exception to my rule of not working on Sundays. However, to make that work, I need to request Monday off instead. I know that's a lot to ask, and if you'd rather me work on Monday than Sunday, I can do that.\
> ___Boss:___ Okay, I think I can do that. But only if you get the problem fixed by Sunday night.\
> ___Me:___ Sounds good! Again, I'm so sorry!

✝ __Scripture:__
> Matthew 12:12 (ESV): "Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."

☝ __First Principle:__
> Although a day of rest is important, the specific day is not. Jesus and Paul made it clear that a legalistic view of the Sabbath does not lead to life. Besides, Sunday is not even the official day of the Sabbath, so as long as I still keep my day of rest on Monday, I am not violating this.

## Option 3: _Fix the bug, working for the Lord_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. Necessitates reliance on the Lord | 1. Possibly violates my commitment to the Lord (Is this my Sabbath? Unclear.) |
| 2. Acknowledges that I work for God, not man | 2. Such willingness could cause my boss to require similar Sunday compomises in the future |
| 3. Takes full responsibility for the situation | 3. Gives me no mental, spiritual, or relational break, possibly leading to burnout |

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ Hey, while I was working on that one feature you told me to, I accidentally introduced a massive bug that makes the system unusable. I know how significant this is, so I'm going to make an exception this one time and fix it over Sunday.\
> ___Boss:___ Okay, thank you for telling me right away. If you get it fixed early in the day, you can take the rest of the day off.\

✝ __Scripture:__
> Colossians 3:23 (ESV): "Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men"\
> Mark 2:27 (ESV): "And he said to them, 'The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.'"

☝ __First Principle:__
> Ultimately, whatever I am doing, whether I'm working or resting, I can do it for the glory of God. As Hebrews says, true rest is ultimately in God, not in a certain day. Therefore, as long as I am resting in God and trusting Him, I can be responsible at work and fix the problem I created.

## 🏁 Conclusion:
> In this conundrum, the main struggle is between two commitments: to God and to work. There is also the added difficulty that I told my work about my commitment to God, so going back on that could reflect poorly on my character to my company as well. I have to ask myself how important not working on Sundays is to me, and if I would have a clear conscience about breaking that rule to right an issue I created.

## ✨Personal Choice:
> I would likely choose option 2 if it came to it: moving my day of rest to Monday. This is a sort of "middle of the road" approach, both acknowledging the need for rest and accepting my responsibility for the problem. While none of these options are perfect, this one has the least extreme consequences.
