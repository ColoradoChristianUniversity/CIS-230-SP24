# Week04 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> While writing some code Saturday night, you realize you have introduced a crippling bug that breaks the entire system. As a Christian, you have politely requested no deadlines, meetings or work ever occur on Sunday. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Option 1: _Inform someone of the bug_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. Maintains my stance on Sundays | 1. Puts the burden of my mistake on someone else |
| 2. Allows the problem to possibly be fixed | 2. Still requires me to contact other people, which could be considered a "meeting" |
| 3. At least acknowledges my mistake | 3. Could result in losing my job, if I don't take further action |


📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ Hey, boss, can I talk to you for a minute? I just realized that I made a huge mistake. While writing this code, I created a bug that is rendering the system non-functional. Since I won't be able to come in to work tomorrow, I wanted to let you know right away. I can point out what I did that caused it, and how I think it could be fixed, and if there are still issues on Monday morning, I promise, I will be the first one in to work on it.\
> ___Boss:___ Are you kidding me?? I've been respecting your request for no work on Sunday, but this is no game. You need to get your butt in here tomorrow and fix the problem you caused!\
> ___Me:___ I understand how serious this is, and I take full responsibility for the situation. I will work as hard as I can until midnight tonight and do everything I can to get the situation resolved. I truly do apologize, but I cannot come in on Sundays. It's not just a preference.\
> ___Boss:___ We will have to talk more about this later. For now, just get the thing fixed.

## Option 2: _Ask for Monday off instead_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. Takes personal responsibility for the solution | 1. Violates my Sunday policy |
| 2. Keeps a day of rest | 2. Eliminates an entire day of productivity on Monday |
| 3. Shows a willingness to put aside personal needs for the company | 3. Shows my boss that I will compromise my policies, if put under enough pressure |

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ Hey, boss, I messed up big time. I was trying to fix part of the code, but I accidentally introduced a huge bug that broke the system. I know it's critical that we get this fixed right away, so I am going to take responsibility for it and make this one exception to my rule of not working on Sundays. However, to make that work, I need to request Monday off instead. I know that's a lot to ask, and if you'd rather me work on Monday than Sunday, I can do that.\
> ___Boss:___ Okay, I think I can do that. But only if you get the problem fixed by Sunday night.\
> ___Me:___ Sounds good! Again, I'm so sorry!

✝ __Scripture:__
> Matthew 12:12 (ESV): "Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."

## Option 3: _Fix the bug, working for the Lord_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. Necessitates reliance on the Lord | 1. Possibly violates my commitment to the Lord (Is this my Sabbath? Unclear.) |
| 2. Acknowledges that I work for God, not man | 2. Such willingness could cause my boss to require similar Sunday compomises in the future |
| 3. Takes full responsibility for the situation | 3. Gives me no mental, spiritual, or relational break, possibly leading to burnout |

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ Hey, while I was working on that one feature you told me to, I accidentally introduced a massive bug that makes the system unusable. I know how significant this is, so I'm going to make an exception this one time and fix it over Sunday.\
> ___Boss:___ Okay, thank you for telling me right away. If you get it fixed early in the day, you can take the rest of the day off.\

✝ __Scripture:__
> Colossians 3:23 (ESV): "Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men"\
> Mark 2:27 (ESV): "And he said to them, 'The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.'"
