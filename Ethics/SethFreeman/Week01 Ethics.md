# Week01 Ethics
## Prompt:
> While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employerâ€™s second largest customer: a well-known pornography web site. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## _Option 1:_ Request for a different team/person to be assigned this issue. 
__Pros:__
> * Allows for a clear conscience.
> * Reveals my stance on this type of issue, hopefully leading to less such assignments in the future.
>
__Cons:__
>* Could cause my boss to see me as a less valuable employee.
>* Potential friction with coworkers who are assigned the project instead of me.
>* Reputation as lazy or as a prude.

__Script:__
> * Me: Sir, I would like to request a different team to cover this customer, if that is alright. Supporting this particular business goes against my religious beliefs.
> * Boss: You're fired. (Hopefully not; alternative: "I will see if _____ can take care of it and put you on another project.")
> * Me: Thank you, sir! I really appreciate your understanding!

__Scripture:__
> * Psalm 101:4 (ESV): "A perverse heart shall be far from me; I will know nothing of evil."

__First Principle:__
> * One should never compromise their conscience for the sake of a reputation or success at work.

## _Option 2:_ Complete the task from a solely professional standpoint, so long as it does not cause me to sin.

__Pros:__
> * Maintains good relationships with boss and coworkers.
> * Avoids friction/awkwardness.
>
__Cons:__
> * Enables others to sin more effectively.
> * Does not stand firm on moral issues.

__Script:__
> * Me: Okay, I will take care of that. I would just like to confirm, though, that this assignment will not require me to interact with the content on the website.
> * Boss: That is correct, they are simply having issues with their secondary payment method.
> * Me: Sounds good! I will get that taken care of.

__Scripture:__
> * John 17:15 (ESV): "I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one."

__First Principle:__
> * It is important to avoid sin, but we can never control other people's sinful actions. We are only responsible for following God ourselves.

## _Option 3:_ Seek a role that allows me to help the customer, but not actively create the solution.

__Pros:__
> * Maintains relatively positive business relationships.
> * Does not actively enable sin.
>
__Cons:__
> * Morality still somewhat questionable.
> * Relatively low value to your employer.

__Script:__
> * Me: Hey, I have a request I would like to make about this assignment. The practices of this business go against my religious beliefs, and I don't feel right about actively working to support them. Is it possible that I could just work with the customer but not directly engineer the solution?
> * Boss: That might work, I will see what I can do. So long as you are not a Christian, I am happy to support your religious beliefs!
> * Me: Uhhhhh...
> * Boss: Wait...you're not a...

__Scripture:__
> * Matthew 10:16 (ESV): "Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves."

__First Principle:__
> * Because it is impossible to completely remove ourselves from this tained world, we will always have to work with sinful people. As long as we are not engaging in or endorsing the sin itself, we can shine Christ's light to these people while working with them.

## Conclusion:

> The main issue here stems from the sinful nature of the business that I would be helping. It is not so much that the people themselves are sinful, but that their very business is a sin. So, by helping them, I would be supporting and enabling sin. However, because I am in a professional workplace, it could cause ill feelings and tension if I simply refuse to do the work. The question is, how much compromise is too much, and where is the line between living in the world and living like the world.

## Personal Choice:

> Out of the options above, I personnally would choose option 3. This would allow me to maintain relatively good relationships with my boss and coworkers without engaging in or enabling sin. At the same time, I would be interacting with the people who work at this company, possibly opening up opportunities for witnessing about Jesus. If my boss makes it clear that this type of role would not be open to me, then I would resort to option 1, asking for a reassignment.
