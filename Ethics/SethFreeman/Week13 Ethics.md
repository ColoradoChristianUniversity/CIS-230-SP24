# Week04 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> While volunteering to help with computers at your church, you are given access to giving records. Because of your work, you unexpectedly discover your senior pastor does not give anything to your church. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Option 1: _Leave it Between Him and the Lord_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Allows the Holy Spirit to work, if he is sinning | Leaves him potentially without human accountability |
| Avoids awkward confrontation that could be seen as disrespect | Could cause me to see him differently from now on by leaving the problem unaddressed |
| Accounts for the fact that he might be giving largely in other ways, whereas giving to the church would potentially just recontribute to his own pay | This behavior could hint at bigger, underlying issues, which if unaddressed could pose problems later on |


📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ Father in Heaven, I pray that you would work in the heart of my pastor. If he is holding back from you, I ask that you would convict him with your Holy Spirit, but if I am misunderstanding, I pray that you would reveal that to me. I pray in Jesus' name, Amen.\

## Option 2: _Privately Ask Him About It_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Follows the process laid out in Matthew 18:15 | Could be a very awkward conversation |
| Confronts the potential sin, while allowing for a misunderstanding | Could lead to questions about why I was looking at the giving records (I have a valid reason, but it would take time to unravel) |
| Involves no one who is not directly concerned | Could cause a strained relationship with the pastor if he is in the wrong, but does not repent |

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ Thank you for meeting with me privately, Pastor ________. I appreciate your time. I just had some questions of a personal nature. When I was working on the computer systems, sorting throught he giving records, I couldn't help but notice that there aren't any records of you giving to this church. I wasn't trying to snoop, it was just part of my job. I don't want to jump to any conclusions or anything, so I just wanted to ask you in person what your policy on this is.\
> ___Pastor:___ Oh, of course! No problem. So, several years ago, when I was at a different church, I was tithing regularly to that church. But the trustees pulled me aside and said that, because my salary is taken from the general offerings, I was actually contributing to my own paycheck. I felt like this was cheating God, in a sense--not giving Him my full tithe--so I started using that money to give to other charities instead. Does that make sense?\
> ___Me:___ Yes, thank you for explaining!

✝ __Scripture:__
> Matthew 18:15 (ESV): "If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother."

## Option 3: _Bring It Up to the Elders_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Allows for more than one person to decide whether it's worth the confrontation or not | Jumps to a more severe solution before tying gentler methods |
| The Senior Pastor is more likely to hear it from other elders than from me | Spreads private information that I had access to because of my special role, betraying that trust |
| Allows for more wisdom to be applied in how to bring it up to the pastor | Will reflect pooly on me if the situation is not what I thought, but I brought it to the elders before finding out the truth |

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ I appreciate all of you agreeing to meet with me. I just saw something in the church giving records that concerned me, and I wanted to get your feedback on it. According to those records, our Senior Pastor doesn't give anything to our own church. Did you know about this? Is it something I should ask him about?\
> ___Elders:___ Oh, that is simply because his paycheck is taken from the offerings, so a portion of his tithe would end up back in his pocket. Thank you for bringing this up to us!
