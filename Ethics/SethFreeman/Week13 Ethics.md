# Week04 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> While volunteering to help with computers at your church, you are given access to giving records. Because of your work, you unexpectedly discover your senior pastor does not give anything to your church. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Option 1: _Leave it Between Him and the Lord_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Allows the Holy Spirit to work, if he is sinning | Leaves him potentially without human accountability |
| Avoids awkward confrontation that could be seen as disrespect | Could cause me to see him differently from now on by leaving the problem unaddressed |
| Accounts for the fact that he might be giving largely in other ways, whereas giving to the church would potentially just recontribute to his own pay | This behavior could hint at bigger, underlying issues, which if unaddressed could pose problems later on |


📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ Father in Heaven, I pray that you would work in the heart of my pastor. If he is holding back from you, I ask that you would convict him with your Holy Spirit, but if I am misunderstanding, I pray that you would reveal that to me. I pray in Jesus' name, Amen.\

✝ __Scripture:__
> 1 Corinthians 4:3-4 (ESV): "But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself. For I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me."

☝ __First Principle:__
> Not tithing to a particular church is not necessarily a direct sin, but rather a matter of conscience. A person's conscience is between them and the Lord, and it is not my place to judge their motives.

## Option 2: _Privately Ask Him About It_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Follows the process laid out in Matthew 18:15 | Could be a very awkward conversation |
| Confronts the potential sin, while allowing for a misunderstanding | Could lead to questions about why I was looking at the giving records (I have a valid reason, but it would take time to unravel) |
| Involves no one who is not directly concerned | Could cause a strained relationship with the pastor if he is in the wrong, but does not repent |

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ Thank you for meeting with me privately, Pastor ________. I appreciate your time. I just had some questions of a personal nature. When I was working on the computer systems, sorting through the giving records, I couldn't help but notice that there aren't any records of you giving to this church. I wasn't trying to snoop, it was just part of my job. I don't want to jump to any conclusions or anything, so I just wanted to ask you in person what your policy on this is.\
> ___Pastor:___ Oh, of course! No problem. So, several years ago, when I was at a different church, I was tithing regularly to that church. But the trustees pulled me aside and said that, because my salary is taken from the general offerings, I was actually contributing to my own paycheck. I felt like this was cheating God, in a sense--not giving Him my full tithe--so I started using that money to give to other charities instead. Does that make sense?\
> ___Me:___ Yes, thank you for explaining!

✝ __Scripture:__
> Matthew 18:15 (ESV): "If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother."

☝ __First Principle:__
> Bringing it up to the pastor directly will not only ease my mind if I'm wrong, but possibly cause repentance if I'm right or reveal a deeper problem that could make the pastor unfit to lead the church. Either way, starting with the individual themselves will seem more respectful than bringing others into it right off the bat.

## Option 3: _Bring It Up to the Elders_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Allows for more than one person to decide whether it's worth the confrontation or not | Jumps to a more severe solution before tying gentler methods |
| The Senior Pastor is more likely to hear it from other elders than from me | Spreads private information that I had access to because of my special role, betraying that trust |
| Allows for more wisdom to be applied in how to bring it up to the pastor | Will reflect poorly on me if the situation is not what I thought, but I brought it to the elders before finding out the truth |

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ I appreciate all of you agreeing to meet with me. I just saw something in the church giving records that concerned me, and I wanted to get your feedback on it. According to those records, our Senior Pastor doesn't give anything to our own church. Did you know about this? Is it something I should ask him about?\
> ___Elders:___ Oh, that is simply because his paycheck is taken from the offerings, so a portion of his tithe would end up back in his pocket. Thank you for bringing this up to us!

✝ __Scripture:__
> 1 Timothy 5:20 (ESV): "As for those who persist in sin, rebuke them in the presence of all, so that the rest may stand in fear."

☝ __First Principle:__
> The elders will be able to address the situation from a place of greater knowledge, experience, and authority. Therefore, bringing it to their attention will help me make the right decision moving forward.

## 🏁 Conclusion:
> In this scenario, I must decide whether or not to address another person's concerning behavior, when it may be simply a matter of their conscience. If I am going to, there is still the tension between keeping it private and seeking guidance on how to address it. The fact that the individual in question is a respected pastor of my church makes the situation even more sticky, because I am speaking as someone under his spiritual authority.

## ✨Personal Choice:
> I would personally choose to abide by option 1: leaving the issue to the Pastor's conscience. Unless it is going to bug me or I won't be able to mentally rest unless I understand, I don't believe the Spirit will convict him if his conscience isn't clear. I think that a person's personal giving to the church is between them and God, and it is not my place to judge their decisions. If I will be tempted to judge him until I understand, then I should choose option 2, but otherwise, option 1 would be my pick.
