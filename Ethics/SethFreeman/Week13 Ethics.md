# Week04 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> While volunteering to help with computers at your church, you are given access to giving records. Because of your work, you unexpectedly discover your senior pastor does not give anything to your church. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Option 1: _Leave it Between Him and the Lord_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Allows the Holy Spirit to work, if he is sinning | Leaves him potentially without human accountability |
| Avoids awkward confrontation that could be seen as disrespect | Could cause me to see him differently from now on by leaving the problem unaddressed |
| Accounts for the fact that he might be giving largely in other ways, whereas giving to the church would potentially just recontribute to his own pay | This behavior could hint at bigger, underlying issues, which if unaddressed could pose problems later on |

## Option 2: _Privately Ask Him About It_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Follows the process laid out in Matthew 18:15 | Could be a very awkward conversation |
| Confronts the potential sin, while allowing for a misunderstanding | Could lead to questions about why I was looking at the giving records (I have a valid reason, but it would take time to unravel) |
| Involves no one who is not directly concerned | Could cause a strained relationship with the pastor if he is in the wrong, but does not repent |

## Option 3: _Bring It Up to the Elders_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Allows for more than one person to decide whether it's worth the confrontation or not | Jumps to a more severe solution before tying gentler methods |
| The Senior Pastor is more likely to hear it from other elders than from me | Spreads private information that I had access to because of my special role, betraying that trust |
| Allows for more wisdom to be applied in how to bring it up to the pastor | Will reflect pooly on me if the situation is not what I thought, but I brought it to the elders before finding out the truth |
