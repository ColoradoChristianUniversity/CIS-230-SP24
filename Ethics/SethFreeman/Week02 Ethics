# Week02 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
## Option 1: _Go along with it_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Keeps everyone you are working with happy.
> * Reduces the potential waste (in resources or time) of the customer.
> * Could provide valuable problem-solving experience.

❌ __Cons:__
> * Will result in many families losing income.
> * Promotes human replacement with computer-guided processes.
> * Takes no personal responsibility for the situation.

📜 __Script:__
> ___Boss:___ I have assigned you to the team that is going to work on the Machine Learning project. You guys need to figure out a solution to speed up the customer's production line.\
___Me:___ Sure thing, boss!\
> ___Me:___ _(Later, talking to customer)_ So, what are your ultimate goals for this solution?\
> ___Customer:___ Well, my hires are just not able to work fast enough to keep up with demand, and I'm losing too much money. I really need this solution to improve my efficiency and replace those employees. Overall, I'm looking to lay off over 175 people!\
> ___Me:___ Oh! ...Great! Well, we will get that done for you!



✝ __Scripture:__
> Romans 12:18 (ESV): "If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all."



☝ __First Principle:__
> As long as you are not sinning or enabling sin, it is usually wise to not be a cause of contension or unencessary difficulties to those around you.


## Option 2: _Try to reason with the customer_

✔ __Pros:__
> * May result in no layoffs.
> * Allows for a completely clear conscience when working on the project.
> * Demonstrates conscientiousness for the welfare of others.

❌ __Cons:__
> * May be acting outside of my professional bounds.
> * Could cause tension with the customer.
> * Makes me appear reluctant to work on the project.

📜 __Script:__
> ___Customer:___ Yeah, this solution is going to help me so much! It will cut down on my costs and really help to streamline my approach. Why, by the time we are done, I'll be able to lay off over 175 employees!\
> ___Me:___ Oh, really? Well, I'm glad we can help you be more efficient! However (and I'm asking this outside of my profession, of course), is executing a mass layoff really the best option? Do you think it might be possible to transfer those people instead? Using our new Machine Learning model, you could expand your business enough to give those employees the opportunity to stay. That way, they don't lose their jobs, and you have a more profitable business.\
> ___Customer:___ Well, I hadn't really thought about that. I just wanted to keep things simple. But you make a good point. I'll look into it!

✝ __Scripture:__
> Proverbs 31:8 (NIV): "Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute."

☝ __First Principle:__
> I should always look out for the best interests of everyone, not just those who are close to me. I should look out for the people that I know will be affected by my actions, and take steps to ensure they are not harmed.

## Option 3: _Seek someone else to take the project_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Takes the whole matter out of my hands.
> * Possibly avoids a difficult project.
> * Allows for a completely clear conscience.

❌ __Cons:__
> * Could likely result in an unfavorable opinion from my boss.
> * Missed opportunity to grow from experience.
> * Does nothing to stop the customer from laying off 750+ people.

📜 __Script:__
> ___Boss:___ I've got a new project for you. This customer would like to cut down on costs and improve efficiency by replacing over 750 employees with a Machine Learning model.\
> ___Me:___ Hey, is it possible that you could have someone else do that? I don't want to be a part of something that will result in so many people losing their livelihoods.\
> ___Boss:___ ...\
> ___Me:___ Pretty please?\
> ___Boss:___ Well...I suppose I can find someone else. But if this becomes a regular occurance, it's going to be a problem. I need to be able to depend on you to get work done. Understood?\
> ___Me:___ Yes, sir.

✝ __Scripture:__
> Galatians 1:10 (ESV): "Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ."

☝ __First Principle:__
> A compromise, whether it is large or small, is still a compromise. It is better to remain unstained from anything unholy, whether it is directly sinful or not.

## 🏁 Conclusion:
> In this situation, the problem arises from the fact that helping this client will potentially hurt the careers and families of a lot of people. It is not sinful, however, so it is not a clear, moral issue. Laying someone off is not a sin, but it does negatively impact their life, so my Machine Learning model could harm the futures of many people. The question is really whether or not this is my concern or something I need to worry about.

## ✨Personal Choice:
> Based on this situation and these options, I would probably choose option 2, reasoning with the customer. Unless they are a very closed-off type of person, I would hope they might be open to friendly conversation. As long as I make it clear that I am not speaking within my professional role, and I listen for signs that they do not want to talk about this, I would hopefully not get in trouble, and I would have done what I could to save the careers of all those people, while not ruining my own.
