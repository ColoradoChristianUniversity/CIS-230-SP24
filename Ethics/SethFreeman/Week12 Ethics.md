# Week04 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> While working your dream job for a major engineering firm, you get an email from HR: immediately put your "preferred pronouns" in your email signature and show up this Thursday with a 🌈 rainbow pin to help celebrate diversity and inclusion. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


## Option 1: _Claim Religious Exemption_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Doesn't compromise my conscience | Will almost certainly cause conflict, and I could still not be granted the exemption |
| Reveals my stance on the subject and my faith | Singles me out as 'uninclusive and hateful' |
| May encourage others of similar beliefs to do likewise | Could possibly result in a demotion or layoff |


📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ Hello, I am calling in response to a recent email regarding the dress code this Thursday. THe email said that we will be required to wear a rainbow pin. However, this practice would violate my religious beliefs, so I am requesting that I be exempted from the requirement. I will not cause any further trouble, and I will keep my beliefs to myself.\
> ___HR Rep:___ I am not sure if I can authorize that. I will get back to you before Thursday.

✝ __Scripture:__
> Acts 5:29 (ESV): "But Peter and the apostles answered, 'We must obey God rather than men.'"

## Option 2: _Request Time Off/Don't Show Up_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Avoids conflict while maintaining a clear conscience | Does not share my belief on the subject, potentially creating more issues down the road |
| Gives me personal time to invest in my family and my relationship with God | Takes valuable time off work, possibly causing issues if I am not granted the time off, but don't show up anyway |
| Allows for me to think over the situation and decide how to approach it in the future | Will still possibly single me out as the person who didn't show up for the 'celebration' |

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ Hey, boss, I'm so sorry for the late notice, but I need to request time off from work tomorrow.\
> ___Boss:___ You're right, this is quite late for that. Is it an emergency?\
> ___Me:___ Yeah, I apologize, but I do specifically need Thrusday off it it's possible.\
> ___Boss:___ (*Sighs*) I will put in the request for you and see if I can make it happen. But you're gonna have a lot of catchup work on Friday.

✝ __Scripture:__
> Proverbs 15:28 (ESV): "The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer, but the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things."

## Option 3: _Speak Out Against the Requirement_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Clearly explains my position and beliefs | Could get me fired for refusing to comply with company policy |
| If God wills, could possibly convict some people's consciences | Will ostracize me from nearly everyone who does not share the same beliefs |
| Opens the door to private conversations about this issue | Will likely push other people away and close some doors of communication |

📜 __Script:__
> ___Co-worker:___ Hey, where's your rainbow pin?\
> ___Me:___ While I respect everyone's personal beliefs, and I am not trying to force my own on people, I can't personally support this celebration. I believe that homosexual relationships are contrary to God's design, and while I don't hate gay people at all, I can't support those actions in a right conscience.\
> ___Co-worker:___ So, what I just heard is that you're a racist, sexist, homophobic, white, male, chauvinistic bigot who endorses the oppression of the underprivilaged and would support Hitler, were he still around!!!
> ___Me:___ What???\
> *\*This is a joke\**

✝ __Scripture:__
> Acts 4:19-20 (ESV) - "But Peter and John answered them, 'Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge.'"
