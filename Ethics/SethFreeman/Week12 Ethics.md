# Week04 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> While working your dream job for a major engineering firm, you get an email from HR: immediately put your "preferred pronouns" in your email signature and show up this Thursday with a 🌈 rainbow pin to help celebrate diversity and inclusion. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


## Option 1: _Claim Religious Exemption_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Doesn't compromise my conscience | Will almost certainly cause conflict, and I could still not be granted the exemption |
| Reveals my stance on the subject and my faith | Singles me out as 'uninclusive and hateful' |
| May encourage others of similar beliefs to do likewise | Could possibly result in a demotion or layoff |

## Option 2: _Request Time Off/Don't Show Up_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Avoids conflict while maintaining a clear conscience | Does not share my belief on the subject, potentially creating more issues down the road |
| Gives me personal time to invest in my family and my relationship with God | Takes valuable time off work, possibly causing issues if I am not granted the time off, but don't show up anyway |
| Allows for me to think over the situation and decide how to approach it in the future | Will still possibly single me out as the person who didn't show up for the 'celebration' |

## Option 3: _Speak Out Against the Requirement_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Clearly explains my position and beliefs | Could get me fired for refusing to comply with company policy |
| If God wills, could possibly convict some people's consciences | Will ostracize me from nearly everyone who does not share the same beliefs |
| Opens the door to private conversations about this issue | Will likely push other people away and close some doors of communication |
