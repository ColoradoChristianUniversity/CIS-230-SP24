# Week04 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> You are a software engineer working for a marketing firm that has been hired by a tobacco company to analyze data for a new product. Your team is excited to work on this project because it could save your struggling company during a bad economy. However, you suspect the customer is intending the product for young audiences, but you are not sure. To make matters worse, you have been trying to build a relationship with a coworker who has criticized religion as judgmental; you are worried that taking a moral stand against this product could come across as hypocritical and cause you to lose the opportunity to reach him just as he is softening to spiritual conversations. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
