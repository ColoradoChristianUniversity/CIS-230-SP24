# Week04 Ethics

## 🤔 Prompt:

> You are a software engineer working for a marketing firm that has been hired by a tobacco company to analyze data for a new product. Your team is excited to work on this project because it could save your struggling company during a bad economy. However, you suspect the customer is intending the product for young audiences, but you are not sure. To make matters worse, you have been trying to build a relationship with a coworker who has criticized religion as judgmental; you are worried that taking a moral stand against this product could come across as hypocritical and cause you to lose the opportunity to reach him just as he is softening to spiritual conversations. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

  

## Option 1: _Cooperate_

  

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |

| ------------- | ------------- |

| Maintains relationship with coworker | Could possibly violate my conscience, depending on my stance |

| Helps the company | Will result in greater use of a harmful substance |

| Avoids conflict and religious stereotyping | Could raise issues with my coworker later on, if my moral position on tobacco comes up |

  
  

📜 __Script:__

> ___Boss:___ We are being contracted by a tobacco company to analyze their data sets and formulate better marketing strategies. We need to figure out our workflow, brainstorm solutions, and assign tasks to our teams.\

> ___Me:___ Okay, sounds good. I will get working on that.\



✝ __Scripture:__

> 1 Corinthians 10:23 (ESV): "‘All things are lawful,’ but not all things are helpful. ‘All things are lawful,’ but not all things build up."



☝ __First Principle:__

> The use of tobacco is (arguably) not directly immoral, and so I am not really endorsing sin. While it may be unwise, unhealthy, and could be used sinfully, the use of the tobacco is not under my control, not should it necessarily be my concern.

  

## Option 2: _Express Moral Concerns_

  

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |

| ------------- | ------------- |

| Keeps a clear conscience | Could damage my relationship with the one coworker |

| Makes my stance clear, so I cannot be called a hypocrite later | Could jeopardize my career position, depending on company policies |

| Could potentially lead to more discussions about the subject, leading ultimately to Christ | Will likely make me a target for religious persecution, or at least ostracism |

  

📜 __Script:__

> ___Boss:___ I am putting your team on the tobacco data project. Get in touch with Rob, and sort out how you are going to split up the work.\

> ___Me:___ Oh, is it possible I could be assigned somewhere else? I don't mean to be particular, but my religious beliefs are against the use of tobacco, so I can't support that project in a clear conscience.\

> ___Boss:___ Ugh. There are some days when I hate the cultural emphasis on toleration and inclusivity of people's beliefs.

  

✝ __Scripture:__

> Ephesians 5:11 (ESV): "Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them."

  

☝ __First Principle:__

> If I cannot support this tobacco company, then I must stand for what I believe. A clear conscience is far more valuable than a conflict-free life, and I would rather hear God tell me "well done" when this life is over than violate my conscience for temporary ease.

  

## Option 3: _Spread Awareness of the Harms of Smoking_

  

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |

| ------------- | ------------- |

| Works to counteract the bad effects of the company | Will not stop the distribution or counteract it on the same scale as I am aiding it |

| Shows my stance on the issue without being blatant in the workplace | Can be complicated and have little effect, if I don't have a good platform |

| Takes action without causing any issues at my work | Could be seen as hypocritical by people who see both types of my work |

  

📜 __Script:__

> ___Me:___ I am here today to spread awareness for the devastating detriments of a prolific substance in our world: tobacco. Although smoking tobacco is long-enforced habit (and let's face it: addiction) for many, it's health detriments are severe. It causes cancer, heart desease, lung damage, and psychological harms as well. In addition, the Bible says that we are not to be dominated by anything. tobacco have dominated the lives of far too many people, and it is time to put a stop to it!\

  

✝ __Scripture:__

> Matthew 5:16 (ESV): "In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven."

  

☝ __First Principle:__

> If I am not going to take action against it in the workplace, then I can at least do what I can to combat the harm outside of the workplace. This way, I do not cause unnecessary issues, but work for what I believe.

  

## 🏁 Conclusion:

> The concern in this ethics conundrum is whether or not the use of tobacco is a direct sin. In addition to this, I must consider how my reaction to the project will influence my career and my work relationships. I do not want to jeopardize the progress I have made spiritually with the one coworker, so I must weigh this against my desire to stand against the use of tobacco.

  

## ✨Personal Choice:

> Although it would depend on a lot of factors, I would choose option 3: spreading awareness of the harms of smoking. I personally do not believe that there is anything inherently sinful about using tobacco, anymore than there is about using alcohol. The sin comes in the overuse or misuse of the product. Therefore, aiding this tobacco company is would not violate my conscience. However, if I could help to reduce the misuse of the substance, then that would reveal my stance on the issue to anyone who cared while not shoving it in the faces of those who don't.
