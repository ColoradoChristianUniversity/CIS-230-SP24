# Week04 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> You are a software engineer working for a marketing firm that has been hired by a tobacco company to analyze data for a new product. Your team is excited to work on this project because it could save your struggling company during a bad economy. However, you suspect the customer is intending the product for young audiences, but you are not sure. To make matters worse, you have been trying to build a relationship with a coworker who has criticized religion as judgmental; you are worried that taking a moral stand against this product could come across as hypocritical and cause you to lose the opportunity to reach him just as he is softening to spiritual conversations. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Option 1: _Cooperate_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Maintains relationship with coworker | Could possibly violate my conscience, depending on my stance |
| Helps the company | Will result in greater use of a harmful substance |
| Avoids conflict and religious stereotyping | Could raise issues with my coworker later on, if my moral position on tabacco comes up |

## Option 2: _Express Moral Concerns_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Keeps a clear conscience | Could damage my relationship with the one coworker |
| Makes my stance clear, so I cannot be called a hypocrite later | Could jeopardize my career position, depending on company policies |
| Could potentially lead to more discussions about the subject, leading ultimately to Christ | Will likely make me a target for religious persecution, or at least ostracism |

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Works to counteract the bad effects of the company | Will not stop the distribution or counteract it on the same scale as I am aiding it |
| Shows my stance on the issue without being blatant in the workplace | Can be complicated and have little effect, if I don't have a good platform |
| Takes action without causing any issues at my work | Could be seen as hypocritical by people who see both types of my work |
