# Week06 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> 🤷‍♂️ The root of this site has the ethics write-up of everyone in class. You can go there, and you can browse and read anyone's essays. Looking back on the first 5 week's prompts, choose the one that resonated with you most. Pick two other students in class and read their options and their choices. In this week's essay, summarize each of those responses with a simple bullet list in your own file and then pretend THEIR CHOICES are the only choices you have (don't go back and revisit your essay for the prompt). Given their choices only, which would YOU choose? Do you agree with the authors? Explain why or why not.
## 🌟 Choice:
__Week03:__
> While maintaining an extremely popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three responses? What do you do?

__Reason:__
> I found this prompt to be interesting because it deals with the conflict between allowing greater evil to continue versus doing a "lesser" evil to accomplish a greater good. Either way, something bad is going to happen. I just get to choose what role I will play in that.

## Student 1: _Mason Link_
__Summary:__
> - Response 1: allow the authorities to introduce the backdoor.
>   - Pros: assists in thwarting the trafficking scheme and obeys the authorities.
>   - Cons: jeopardizes security of open source project and puts project users at risk.
>   - Verse: Romans 13:1
> - Response 2: refuse to add the backdoor.
>   - Pros: maintains security and maintains trust with the users.
>   - Cons: hurts the efforts to stop the trafficking scheme and disobeys the authorities.
>   - Verse: Exodus 18:21
> - Response 3: add the backdoor, but tell the users that the authorities are collecting data through the platform.
>   - Pros: is transparent with the users and also attempts to cooperate with the authorities.
>   - Cons: the authorities may have an issue with the transparency and many users will likely stop using the product.
>   - Verse: Proverbs 21:3

__Reflection:__
> In Mason's assignment, he personally chose the third response, to add the backdoor, but tell the users that data is being collected. His reasoning for this choice was that stopping the child trafficking is much more important than the security of an open-source project. However, the reputation of the project and the trust of the users is also important, he asserted, although they do come second.\
> I agree with Mason's choice. From the options he provided, I would also take the middle road, not fully satisfying either party, but compromising and maintaining my integrity meanwhile. For me, even if I had to shut down the open-source project, it would be worth it if it saved all of those kids from the horrible life that they are being subjected to. While I would not do something outright evil to stop the traffickers, as that would be fighting evil with evil, I would go to great lengths, including sacrificing good things, such as the project.


## Student 2: _Gabe Wassmer_
__Summary:__
> - Response 1: refuse to introduce the backdoor.
>   - Pros: upholds the integrity of the project, avoids possible legal/ethical issues, and sets a precedent against government overreach.
>   - Cons: could incur pressure or consequences from the authorities, create negative publicity, and possibly thwart the effort to stop the illegal trafficking (leading to guilt).
>   - Verse: Proverbs 21:23
>   - Script: He refuses to add the backdoor because it goes against the project's core principles. The authorities re-emphasize the severity of the situation, but he responds that he still cannot do it, asking if there is any other way he can help.
>   - Principle: keeping integrity ensures trust.
> - Response 2: seek legal advice besides the authorities.
>   - Pros: can help determine the legal implications, enable an informed decision, and shows that you will not let the government force you to infringe on others' privacy.
>   - Cons: may not provide a clear answer, does not address the moral aspect, and retains risks of legal repercussions.
>   - Verse: Proverbs 12:15
>   - Script: he says that he wants to seek other legal counsel before proceding, to which the authorities respond that time is of the essence. He says that he owes it to the users to proceed cautiously and avoid legal/ethical issues.
>   - Principle: this approach promotes impartial advice and can help you to make a responsible decision.
> - Response 3: introduce the backdoor.
>   - Pros: may help stop the criminal activity, fulfils civic duty, and minimizes the potential consequences of disobeying the authorities.
>   - Cons: compromises the project's integrity, sets a dangerous precedent for government overreach, and creates a slipperly slope which may lead to more backdoor access requested in the future.
>   - Verse: Isaiah 5:20
>   - Script: he decides to introduce the backdoor, even though it goes against his principles, and the authorities thank him for his cooperation.
>   - Principle: it is a difficult decision between society's immediate good and the long-term consequences.

__Reflection:__
> Gabe concludes by emphasizing the difficulty of the situation and the many factors that must be considered. He notes that one's decision will have broader implications than this one situation, but that it might impact the future of privacy, trust, and digital rights. Then, he states that his personal choice is option two, to seek other legal advice. This, he said, is because he would want to be responsible in his consideration and make an informed decision, balancing the urgent need with the weighty moral issues.\
> Out of the options he presented, I would agree with him, that this is the best option. It would not only give me time, but provide a more neutral opinion on the situation and perhaps bring to my attention points that I had not considered before. Plus, if my answer still ended up being "no," then I would actually have plausible excuses and reasons to give the authorities so that they do not just think I am being stubborn.
