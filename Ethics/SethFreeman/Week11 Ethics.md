# Week04 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> While working for the government, you are asked to solve a seemingly impossible problem in 2 months. You find a third-party software that can do it, but procurement takes 6 months at a minimum. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Option 1: _Request an extension_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Gives me more time to procure the third-party solution | Will likely not result in a 4 month extension, so it might not help me get the third-party software |
| Could also give me more time to work on it myself if necessary | Makes me appear less valuable to my employer |
| Avoids unexplained tardiness on the solution | Will probably not gain sympathy from the manager who assignmed the the task, but just come across as complaining |


📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ Hey, boss, this project seems like it is going to realistically take much longer than 2 months. There is a third-party software that could solve it, but it would require at least 6 months to procure. Is it possible that I could get an extension on the project? If you can't do six months, at least any extra time will help me figure it out on my own.\
> ___Boss:___ We really need this done as soon as possible, but I will check with my boss and see what I can do.\

## Option 2: _Enlist/request assistance_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Will expodite the procedure, helping me get it done on time | Drags other people away from other work they could be doing |
| Shows initiative to do what's necessary to get the job done | Introduces extra complexity for coordination |
| Avoids altering the initial timing | Possibly makes me look inefficient, if I require more to accomplish a task assigned only to me |

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ Realistically, I don't think I can finish this project in only two months by myself. Can I pull together a team to work on it, or is there anyone you could reassign to help me so we can deliver on time?\
> ___Char2___ Of course, if you can find some guys, go for it. And I think I can spare another man from a different team. The most important thing is that it is finished on time.\

## Option 3: _Pray for wisdom_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Requires faith in God and reliance on His wisdom | Does not guarantee results |
| Uses the resources available to me without requiring more | Does not share my timing dilemma with someone who would have the power to make changes |
| Could possibly lead to an even better solution than the third-party software uses | Will lead to awkward questions if I fail, and my only excuse is that "God didn't show me how to solve it", especially in a secular workplace |

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ Father in heaven, I ask that you would give me wisdom with this assignment. I feel inadequate, and I have no idea what to do or how to solve it. Please, if it's your will, show me the way, and help me to be faithful to my employer and do excellent work for you.\
> ___God:___ Just add the semicolon at the end of line 357.\
> ___Me:___ Bless the Lord, O my soul!!!\

## 🏁 Conclusion:
> In this situation, the problem presented is not so much a moral one as a resource one. There is just not enough time, so I must decide how to maximize my chances of accomplishing the task in time. Added to this is the fact that I simply don't know how to solve the problem, so it could take me any amount of time to figure it out. I cannot do this on my own, so my main concern is to whom/what I should turn for help.

## ✨Personal Choice:
> Not to give the "standard Christian answer", but I would choose the third option: praying for wisdom. While this might not seem the most practical solution, I know that God does work through prayer, and I have many personal stories (and stories from my dad, who is an IT professional) of times when God has helped me solve something impossible under time constraints. I believe that He mainly wants me to trust Him, and He puts things like this in my life to test whether I will seek my own solution or rely on Him for His.
