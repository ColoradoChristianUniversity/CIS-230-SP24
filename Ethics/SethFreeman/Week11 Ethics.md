# Week04 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> While working for the government, you are asked to solve a seemingly impossible problem in 2 months. You find a third-party software that can do it, but procurement takes 6 months at a minimum. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Option 1: _Request an extension_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Gives me more time to procure the third-party solution | Will likely not result in a 4 month extension, so it might not help me get the third-party software |
| Could also give me more time to work on it myself if necessary | Makes me appear less valuable to my employer |
| Avoids unexplained tardiness on the solution | Will probably not gain sympathy from the manager who assignmed the the task, but just come across as complaining |
