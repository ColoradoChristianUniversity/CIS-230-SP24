# Week04 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> While working for the government, you are asked to solve a seemingly impossible problem in 2 months. You find a third-party software that can do it, but procurement takes 6 months at a minimum. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Option 1: _Request an extension_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Gives me more time to procure the third-party solution | Will likely not result in a 4 month extension, so it might not help me get the third-party software |
| Could also give me more time to work on it myself if necessary | Makes me appear less valuable to my employer |
| Avoids unexplained tardiness on the solution | Will probably not gain sympathy from the manager who assignmed the the task, but just come across as complaining |

## Option 2: _Enlist/request assistance_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Will expodite the procedure, helping me get it done on time | Drags other people away from other work they could be doing |
| Shows initiative to do what's necessary to get the job done | Introduces extra complexity for coordination |
| Avoids altering the initial timing | Possibly makes me look inefficient, if I require more to accomplish a task assigned only to me |

## Option 3: _Pray for wisdom_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Requires faith in God and reliance on His wisdom | Does not guarantee results |
| Uses the resources available to me without requiring more | Does not share my timing dilemma with someone who would have the power to make changes |
| Could possibly lead to an even better solution than the third-party software uses | Will lead to awkward questions if I fail, and my only excuse is that "God didn't show me how to solve it", especially in a secular workplace |
