# Week04 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> While working on a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three responses? What do you do?
## Option 1: _Suggest counseling_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Could help this person through their internal crisis.
> * Follows the mainstream approach.
> * Points the teammate to someone more qualified than myself.

❌ __Cons:__
> * If the teammate does not follow my advice, I have done nothing to solve the problem.
> * Secular counseling will not necessarily lead this person to better mental health.
> * This approach leaves my employer unaware of a potentially debilitating liability.

📜 __Script:__
> ___Teammate:___ Hey, I just have to tell someone. Understand that this is in confidence. But I just have to say, I have been suffering from severe depression recently, and it's not getting any better.\
> ___Me:___ Oh, I'm so sorry! Is there anything I can do to help? Have you tried counseling yet?\
> ___Teammate:___ No, I haven't. Haven't done anything.\
> ___Me:___ Well, I would strongly suggest that you go see a counselor. They will be able to help you through this and get you back to feeling good again.

✝ __Scripture:__
> Proverbs 19:20 (ESV): "Listen to advice and accept instruction, that you may gain wisdom in the future."

☝ __First Principle:__
> While providing emotional support and just listening to someone in depression is important, a trained professional will have better knowledge about how to help them.

## Option 2: _Inform your employer_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Least risk to the company.
> * Shows my boss that I have the greater good of the company in mind and that I am open and honest.
> * Puts the whole situation into the hands of the people that are responsible for the company.

❌ __Cons:__
> * Betrays the trust of my teammate.
> * Shows no personal care for the situation.
> * Could start a reputation as an informant.

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ Hey, boss, I just learned something that I thought I should bring to your attention. Robert told me that he has been struggling with major depression, and it seems to be affecting his performance. I am not suggesting that he should be terminated or anything like that, but since this project is so important, I thought it would be best to let you know so you could handle it as you see fit.\
> ___Boss:___ Thank you for bringing this up. I will talk to Robert about it and see what the best solution will be.\

✝ __Scripture:__
> Luke 8:17 (ESV): "For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light."

☝ __First Principle:__
> As much as I might want to help this person, the issue is bigger than the two of us. My boss is responsible for managing my team and making sure the project is finished, so anything that threatens the project is their responsibility.

## Option 3: _Share Jesus_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Could bring this person to salvation.
> * Is consistent with my faith, my calling, and my conscience.
> * Has the potential to completely solve the problem without bringing other people into it.

❌ __Cons:__
> * Could push the co-worker away, if they do not receive it.
> * Does not involve my boss, whose responsibility this whole project is.
> * Could possibly bring religious persecution if word of my advice is spread.

📜 __Script:__
> ___Teammate:___ Hey, I have to tell you, I've been struggling with serious depression recently, and I just can't seem to make meaning out of anything.\
> ___Me:___ Oh no, I'm so sorry! I've been there before, and I know how it feels. But now, I've found purpose and meaning to life. Would you like to hear about what gives me hope?\
> ___Teammate:___ I guess...
> ___Me:___ Well, His name is Jesus...

✝ __Scripture:__
> Matthew 28:19 (ESV): "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit"

☝ __First Principle:__
> Jesus is the only One who can bring true hope and save someone from depression. If I truly care about my teammate, I will share with him the hope that I have been given.

## 🏁 Conclusion:
> The major tension that I see in this situation is that ultimately, this problem is a lot bigger than me and my teammate. Their depression could jeopardize the welfare of our company's future if it is not addressed. On top of this, it is not my responsibility or my call to decide what should happen with this person. However, it could cause undesirable tension if I betray my co-worker's confidence for the good of the company.

## ✨Personal Choice:
> Personally, I would choose option 3: sharing Jesus with this employee. I know that, whatever the case and whatever modern psychology might tell you, Jesus is the only true source of hope. He is the only way to life. If even after sharing Jesus, the company's future is still in trouble, then I might talk with my boss. But I would start with option 3.
