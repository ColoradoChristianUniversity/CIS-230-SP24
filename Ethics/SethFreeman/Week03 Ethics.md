# Week02 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> While maintaining an extremely popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three responses? What do you do?
## Option 1: _Refuse_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Does not violate users' trust.
> * Is simple and doesn't require more coding.
> * Eliminates potential fallout if the backdoor is discovered.

❌ __Cons:__
> * Does nothing to stop the online child trafficking.
> * Could put me in an uncomfortable place with the authorities.
> * Wastes an opportunity to make connections that could open up better job opportunities, and potentially government contracts, in the future.

📜 __Script:__
> ___Govt. Agent:___ We have good reason to believe that a large child trafficking organization is using your open-source platform to conduct some of their operations. If you secretly introduce a backdoor so that we have visibility into what is being said and conducted, then that will help us catch the criminals and put a stop to the operation.\
> ___Me:___ I'm sorry, I don't feel right about doing that. I feel like it violates the whole concept of an open-source project, and it could create problems in the future. If there is anything I can do to help with this situation without violating the open-source aspect of my project, though, let me know!\
> ___Govt. Agent:___ I'm sorry to hear that this is your decision. I sincerely ask that you think it over again and spend some time considering what will be in the best public interest. However, we will not force you.\
> ___Me:___ Okay, I will do that.

✝ __Scripture:__
> Luke 8:17 (ESV): "For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light."

☝ __First Principle:__
> We should never take part in evil, even if it is for an ultimately good cause. Since it would probably be wrong to introduce such a backdoor into this project, the good of stopping the child trafficking doesn't make it okay. There has to be another way.

## Option 2: _Update the license agreement to allow for a backdoor_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Allows for the authorities to catch the criminals.
> * Does not violate the trust of the users.
> * Keeps the authorities happy.

❌ __Cons:__
> * Since few people actually read the license agreement, it may cause backlash and make me look sneaky.
> * The criminals could possibly actually read the license agreement and discover the plot.
> * It is still partially deceptive, since I know very few people will read the part of the agreement that allows for a backdoor.

📜 __Script:__
> ___Govt. Agent:___ So, what is your answer? Will you help us save hundreds, perhaps thousands, of children from human trafficking?\
> ___Me:___ I just don't feel right about going behind the backs of all of my users. However, I could add a clause in the license agreement that allows me to retain the right to add a backdoor. That way, it is the fault of the user if they do not realize there could be a backdoor.\
> ___Govt. Agent:___ However, that could possibly alert the criminals to the insecurity of the platform. It could potentially ruin the whole operation.\
> ___Me:___ I doubt that they will read through the entire agreement or even understand the ramifications of the added clause. But either way, it is the only way that I will feel right about cooperating with your request. If you think it is too great of a risk, then we will have to find another way.

✝ __Scripture:__
> Psalm 106:3 (ESV): "Blessed are they who observe justice, who do righteousness at all times!"

☝ __First Principle:__
> While helping the authorities to aid these children and shut down the ungodly, unlawful operation, it isn't right to do evil for the sake of good.

## Option 3: _Add the backdoor, but only if you have full visibility into how it is used_

✔ __Pros:__
> * The surest way to catch the criminals.
> * Prevents improper use of the backdoor.
> * 

❌ __Cons:__
> * Could likely result in an unfavorable opinion from my boss.
> * Missed opportunity to grow from experience.
> * Does nothing to stop the customer from laying off 750+ people.

📜 __Script:__
> ___Boss:___ I've got a new project for you. This customer would like to cut down on costs and improve efficiency by replacing over 750 employees with a Machine Learning model.\
> ___Me:___ Hey, is it possible that you could have someone else do that? I don't want to be a part of something that will result in so many people losing their livelihoods.\
> ___Boss:___ ...\
> ___Me:___ Pretty please?\
> ___Boss:___ Well...I suppose I can find someone else. But if this becomes a regular occurance, it's going to be a problem. I need to be able to depend on you to get work done. Understood?\
> ___Me:___ Yes, sir.

✝ __Scripture:__
> Galatians 1:10 (ESV): "Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ."

☝ __First Principle:__
> A compromise, whether it is large or small, is still a compromise. It is better to remain unstained from anything unholy, whether it is directly sinful or not.

## 🏁 Conclusion:
> In this situation, the problem arises from the fact that helping this client will potentially hurt the careers and families of a lot of people. It is not sinful, however, so it is not a clear, moral issue. Laying someone off is not a sin, but it does negatively impact their life, so my Machine Learning model could harm the futures of many people. The question is really whether or not this is my concern or something I need to worry about.

## ✨Personal Choice:
> Based on this situation and these options, I would probably choose option 2, reasoning with the customer. Unless they are a very closed-off type of person, I would hope they might be open to friendly conversation. As long as I make it clear that I am not speaking within my professional role, and I listen for signs that they do not want to talk about this, I would hopefully not get in trouble, and I would have done what I could to save the careers of all those people, while not ruining my own.
