# Week02 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> While maintaining an extremely popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three responses? What do you do?
## Option 1: _Refuse_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Does not violate users' trust.
> * Is simple and doesn't require more coding.
> * Eliminates potential fallout if the backdoor is discovered.

❌ __Cons:__
> * Does nothing to stop the online child trafficking.
> * Could put me in an uncomfortable place with the authorities.
> * Wastes an opportunity to make connections that could open up better job opportunities, and potentially government contracts, in the future.

📜 __Script:__
> ___Govt. Agent:___ We have good reason to believe that a large child trafficking organization is using your open-source platform to conduct some of their operations. If you secretly introduce a backdoor so that we have visibility into what is being said and conducted, then that will help us catch the criminals and put a stop to the operation.\
> ___Me:___ I'm sorry, I don't feel right about doing that. I feel like it violates the whole concept of an open-source project, and it could create problems in the future. If there is anything I can do to help with this situation without violating the open-source aspect of my project, though, let me know!\
> ___Govt. Agent:___ I'm sorry to hear that this is your decision. I sincerely ask that you think it over again and spend some time considering what will be in the best public interest. However, we will not force you.\
> ___Me:___ Okay, I will do that.

✝ __Scripture:__
> Luke 8:17 (ESV): "For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light."

☝ __First Principle:__
> We should never take part in evil, even if it is for an ultimately good cause. Since it would probably be wrong to introduce such a backdoor into this project, the good of stopping the child trafficking doesn't make it okay. There has to be another way.

## Option 2: _Update the license agreement to allow for a backdoor_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Allows for the authorities to catch the criminals.
> * Does not violate the trust of the users.
> * Keeps the authorities happy.

❌ __Cons:__
> * Since few people actually read the license agreement, it may cause backlash and make me look sneaky.
> * The criminals could possibly actually read the license agreement and discover the plot.
> * It is still partially deceptive, since I know very few people will read the part of the agreement that allows for a backdoor.

📜 __Script:__
> ___Govt. Agent:___ So, what is your answer? Will you help us save hundreds, perhaps thousands, of children from human trafficking?\
> ___Me:___ I just don't feel right about going behind the backs of all of my users. However, I could add a clause in the license agreement that allows me to retain the right to add a backdoor. That way, it is the fault of the user if they do not realize there could be a backdoor.\
> ___Govt. Agent:___ However, that could possibly alert the criminals to the insecurity of the platform. It could potentially ruin the whole operation.\
> ___Me:___ I doubt that they will read through the entire agreement or even understand the ramifications of the added clause. But either way, it is the only way that I will feel right about cooperating with your request. If you think it is too great of a risk, then we will have to find another way.

✝ __Scripture:__
> Psalm 106:3 (ESV): "Blessed are they who observe justice, who do righteousness at all times!"

☝ __First Principle:__
> While helping the authorities to aid these children and shut down the ungodly, unlawful operation, it isn't right to do evil for the sake of good.

## Option 3: _Ask for time to pray and consider_

✔ __Pros:__
> * Allows for a godly response later.
> * Does not commit myself before I know what I should do.
> * Allows the Lord to lead me in whatever direction is right for the particular situation and time.

❌ __Cons:__
> * Allows kids to continue to be trafficked while I take my time.
> * Does nothing to solve the immediate issue, putting it off until later.
> * Could cause the government to grow impatient.

📜 __Script:__
> ___Govt. Agent:___ Will you help us?\
> ___Me:___ I'm sorry, but this is a very important issue. I think I will need to take some time to think about it. Is it okay if I get back to you in two days?\
> ___Govt. Agent:___ I believe I can arrange that. But don't take any longer than you need to. This is a time-sensitive issue!

✝ __Scripture:__
> James 1:5 (ESV): "If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him."

☝ __First Principle:__
> Decisions should always be made with God, never apart from Him. For something as convoluted as this, a person needs to take time to seek the Lord and see where He will lead him.

## 🏁 Conclusion:
> This scenario poses the question, "is it right to do evil for the sake of good." While pretty much everyone can agree that it isn't right to intruduce a backdoor into an open source project, the fact that it is for a good cause makes the issue more sticky. One must ask themselves if performing the "lesser evil" of violating users' trust is worth the "greater good" of saving uncounted kids from being abused.

## ✨Personal Choice:
> Although it might seem like the "cop-out answer," I would choose option 3, taking some time to think and pray about it. This is because I think God's answer on this could be different depending on the time, situation, and circumstances. To one person, He might lead them to completely refuse to keep their conscience clear. To another person, or even just another time, He might cause them to choose option 2. However, it is always wise to seek the Lord's guidance, so I would go with this option, no matter what.
