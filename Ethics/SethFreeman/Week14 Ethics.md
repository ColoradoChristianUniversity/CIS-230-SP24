# Week04 Ethics
## 🤔 Prompt:
> You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets. The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until put under the scrutiny of your tool. They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better secularize public places. You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years. The product manager speculates it could potentially be licensed to foreign governments in the future wanting to accomplish similar goals. However, you also have misgivings. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Option 1: _Pray for Christ's Return_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Encourages faith in God and a kingdom focus | Does nothing to counteract the attack on religion |
| Causes least friction or problems | Will likely result in less religious freedoms for my children |
| Acknowledges God's sovereignty | Suppresses my own ability to express my faith |


📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ Father in Heaven, I know that this is all a part of your Will. I know that you will triumph over Satan's schemes in the end, but that the time before will result in heavy persecution. I pray that you would forgive me for any role I had in moving this persecution forward. Your Will be done. Amen.

✝ __Scripture:__
> Matthew 24:9-10 (ESV): "Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake. And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another."

☝ __First Principle:__
> Ultimately, persecution will increase before Christ returns, so whether I have a hand in accelerating it or not, God's Will will be accomplished, and the outcome will be the same.

## Option 2: _Consider Alternate Employment_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Shows my position on the subject clearly | Could result in a worse career |
| Allows me to find a job more suited to my lifestyle and beliefs | Does not stop the impacts of the tool I already worked on |
| Lets me keep a clear conscience | Could mark me as a target for future religious persecution |

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ I have given this a lot of thought, and I have decided that this company and me are trying to move in different directions. I cannot support the goals and principles of this company. I truly appreciate the opportunity to work here, and I value every day I've spent as your employee, but I have decided to resign from my position.\
> ___Boss:___ I'll buy you Chick-Fil-A to stay.\
> ___Me:___ 😏

✝ __Scripture:__
> Acts 24:16 (ESV): "So I always take pains to have a clear conscience toward both God and man."

☝ __First Principle:__
> I should never allow my career to compromise my faith. If I am in a position where my job is at odds with God, I cannot remain there.

## Option 3: _Join an Institution for Religious Inclusion_

| 🟢 Pros      | 🔴 Cons       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Works to counteract the negative use of the tool | May appear as hypocritical to people on both sides of the issue |
| Makes me an active force in God's kingdom | Might not significantly impact the consequences of the tool |
| Reveals my stance on the issue without ending my career | Will take up valuable time from my job, possibly resulting in lower performance |

📜 __Script:__
> ___Me:___ _(Inner dialogue)_ What can I do to support what I believe in without either ruining my career or appearing insufferably prudish? Hmm... Well, this tool is ultimately going to be used by the government, so if I fight a political battle for religious acceptance in public, then perhaps I can undo some of the damage it will cause.

✝ __Scripture:__
> Acts 5:29 (ESV): "But Peter and the apostles answered, 'We must obey God rather than men.'"

☝ __First Principle:__
> A tool is just a tool; neither evil nor good. It is the use of the tool that can have moral implications, but that use is not up to me, as the developer. Thus, the best thing I can do is work against that ungodly use outside of my career.

## 🏁 Conclusion:
> In this situation, I start out in an already-compromised position. I have made questionable choices in the past, and now I must decide how to move forward. If I change my stance on the issue, I will appear hypocritical, but on the other hand, I cannot keep violating my conscience. This is another issue of personal morality, so I must determine what will honor God the most and allow me a clean conscience.

## ✨Personal Choice:
> Given the situation, I would probably choose option 3: joining an institution for religious acceptance. The way I see it, the damage is already done, and me resigning or protesting will have a negligible effect. While I might still consider changing companies in the long run to find a better fit with my beliefs, my current best option is to do what I can outside my profession to counteract the use of the amoral tool I helped to create.
