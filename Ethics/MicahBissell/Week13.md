# Week 13 Ethics Assignment

## Prompt
While volunteering to help with computers at your church, you are given access to giving records. Because of your work, you unexpectedly discover your senior pastor does not give anything to your church. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Possible Responses

### **Response 1: Confront the Pastor Privately**
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Encourages the pastor to be clear in future communication with the church body | Is likely to cause division between the pastor and me if he doesn't take it well |
| Leaves room for possible misunderstandings | Could be touching on a sensitive topic if there's an alternate reason for him not to be giving (medical problems, mental health issues, etc.) |
| Keeps him honest with himself, maybe calls him out for the first time |  |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [pastor], I was recently doing some recordkeeping duties for the church and I noticed that your name isn't in the giving records. Is there something going on there?"
  - Pastor: "Thanks for reaching out about your concern. I don't have an excuse. I'm sorry and I'll try to do better."
- **Biblical Reference:** "A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger." - Proverbs 15:1 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** This option leaves room for potential misunderstandings to be cleared up and also directly approaches the source of the problem. It's a good choice for anyone who is willing to deal with a potentially awkward conversation.

### **Response 2: Do Nothing, let it Happen**
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| You avoid conflict with the pastor | Doesn't really address the problem |
| Leaves the matter between the pastor and God | Might cause pastor to believe his actions are okay in the eyes of the church if he finds out you didn't say anything about it |
|  | Might weigh on your own conscience for not speaking up |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "That's weird, [pastor] hasn't been tithing. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and trust that he's wrestling with this on his own."
- **Biblical Reference:** "A personâ€™s wisdom yields patience; it is to oneâ€™s glory to overlook an offense." - Proverbs 19:11 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** This choice allows you to give someone who might be struggling the benefit of the doubt. It avoids potential conflict which could snowball into bigger problems down the road. It might not directly address the problem, but it displays a trust in God that He can handle it in the offender's own heart.

### **Response 3: Talk to Other Church Leaders**
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Approaches the problem in a thoughtful way, bringing others who may know more about the situation into the loop | Pastor might feel that you're "ganging up" on him, leading to more negative reactions |
| Allows your church to establish clear expectations for the pastor moving forward | Could cause division if other leaders support the pastor for whatever reason |
| Deals with the problem as part of a team rather than solo | Possibly exposes some circumstances that shouldn't be exposed to the congregation |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [leaders], I was recently doing some recordkeeping duties for the church and I noticed that [pastor's] name isn't in the giving records. Is there something going on there?"
  - Leader: "I'm not sure what's going on there but thank you for bringing it to our attention. We'll address it from here."
- **Biblical Reference:** "Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses. But those elders who are sinning you are to reprove before everyone, so that the others may take warning." - 1 Timothy 5:19-20
- **First Principle:** This option approaches the problem from a perspective of being willing to learn and possibly even being willing to give the pastor the benefit of the doubt, but also gives validity to the opinions of the other members of your church. The possible downsides shouldn't be taken lightly, but it also possibly provides the best upside.

### My Reponse
I would choose response 1, confronting the pastor privately. This option shows him that you care about him as a person and want to support him through whatever struggles he might be going through, but also shows that you see his actions as problematic and worthy of addressing. It leaves room for possible misunderstandings.
