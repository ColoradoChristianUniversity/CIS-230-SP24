# Week 14 Ethics Assignment

## Prompt
You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets. The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until put under the scrutiny of your tool. They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better secularize public places. You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years. The product manager speculates it could potentially be licensed to foreign governments in the future wanting to accomplish similar goals. However, you also have misgivings. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Possible Responses

### **Response 1: Work with your Team to Pause Development of the Tool and Advocate for Other Applications**
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Prevents the tool from being used to censor religious images in public, at least for a while | Delaying this project will likely have a negative impact on value to shareholders, who won't be happy with you |
| Gives you more time to continue to think, possibly shift gears at some point down the line | Might cause conflict between team members if not everybody is on board |
| Might be good for building relationships with teammates | Even if you do succeed in persuading the government agency to repurpose the tool, it might take added time to develop it for its new role |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [team], I know we're all excited about this tool that we've been working so hard on finally coming to fruition- I'm just not sure if I can support how the government agency plans on using it. What if we paused development and suggested they use it for something else, like identifying obscene graffiti?"
  - Teammate: "I like that idea. I think there are definitely other ways we can be using this technology that don't block religious imagery in public."
- **Biblical Reference:** "If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesnâ€™t do it, it is sin for them." - James 4:17 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** This is a good moderate choice- it doesn't completely tank development of the project and even proposes an alternate solution for people on both sides. It might be challenging to persuade the government agency to change their plans, but coming at that discussion from an angle of humility and with support of your team is arguably the best way to deal with this problem.

### **Response 2: Attempt to Singlehandedly Rewrite Parts of the Tool to Prevent it Being used to Spot Religious Imagery**
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| If successful, prevents the tool from being used to identify religious imagery | Probably extremely complex, maybe even impossible as a one-man job |
| Allows you to stand by your morals, however extreme | Making unapproved changes is borderline sabotaging your team, might cause you to feel guilty about your actions |
|  | The government agency would probably be angry with you if they found out you specifically pushed back against their stated goals |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [team], I know we're all excited about this tool that we've been working so hard on finally coming to fruition- I'm just not sure if I can support how the government agency plans on using it. I don't feel comfortable letting this go and I want to try and prevent it from being used to identify religious imagery. I don't need direct help but I could use moral support."
  - Teammate: "Yeah we're not sure about it either. Do what you need to do."
- **Biblical Reference:** "Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification." - Romans 14:9 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** If you feel like taking the situation into your own hands, this is the way to go. This puts the bulk of the responsibility on your own shoulders, but you're the one who has a problem to begin with so that's fair. As a member of the team, your opinion should be valued and supported, and in this case, editing the tool on your own may be the best way to accomplish this.

### **Response 3: Do Nothing, Trust that God will Resolve the Situation According to His Will**
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Doesn't have you bear the weight of all the responsibility | Means you have to be okay with all the negative effects you were afraid of coming to pass |
| Displays ultimate trust in God's plans | Could weigh on your conscience if the tool does end up being used for religious persecution |
| Does the job, avoids conflict between teammates and/or you and the government agency | No way to "put the cat back in the bag"- once you release the tool to the government as it is there's no way to police what they do with it |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [team], I know we're all excited about this tool that we've been working so hard on finally coming to fruition- I'm just not sure if I can support how the government agency plans on using it. I don't feel super comfortable but I know how much work we've put into it and I trust that God will oversee this how He sees fit."
  - Teammate: "That's a good outlook. I'm excited to see how far this software goes."
- **Biblical Reference:** "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose." - Romans 8:28 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** This is probably the most practical of the three options. It effectively is just the result of you continuing to work at your job and do the duties that have been assigned to you. It might not lead to change, but it does show a good level of trust in the Lord and His will over the situation.

### My Response
I would attempt option 1, trying to delay the release of the tool. It's not a perfect solution in part due to the financial/political situation you would force the company into, but I think it shows a good balance between trusting God's will and taking matters into your own hands. It also lets you communicate to your team, to the government agency, and to any other involved parties that you don't approve of how your tool is being used. I think this has the best chance of working and it's not too aggressive.
