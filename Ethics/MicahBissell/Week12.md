# Week 12 Ethics Assignment

## Prompt
While working your dream job for a major engineering firm, you get an email from HR: immediately put your "preferred pronouns" in your email signature and show up this Thursday with a ðŸŒˆ rainbow pin to help celebrate diversity and inclusion. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Possible Responses

### **Response 1: Politely Request to be Exempted from both Requirements**
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| You hold to your beliefs | You alienate the people the initiative is meant for |
| You set a clear boundary moving forward | You risk causing strife between the rest of the team |
| You might lead the way for other teammates who feel the same way but don't want to speak up | You set yourself apart from coworkers in a visible, tangible way, potentially raising questions among customers |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [boss], I read the memo about the DEI initiatives and I want to ask if I could be exempted. I feel that my faith in Christ leads me to avoid supporting the initiative in this way- although I do want people to feel included at [company], I can't support this particular movement."
  - Boss: "It'll cause division among [team]. Are you sure?"
  - You: "I can acknowledge that but I'm sure."
  - Boss: "All right then. You don't have to use the pronouns or the badge for now."
- **Biblical Reference:** "Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what Godâ€™s will isâ€”his good, pleasing and perfect will." - Romans 12:2 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** This is a defensible option because it keeps you strictly in line with certain Biblical values- choosing not to support the LGBTQ initiative put on by your company might set you apart from your coworkers, but this might be a good thing if it leads other members of your team to follow in your footsteps and defend their beliefs.

### **Response 2: Use Both Pronouns and Pin**
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| You avoid conflict with teammates/customers | You might mislead people you interact with |
| This is simply going along with what the company asked of you | Might prevent other teammates with reservations about the intiiative from coming forward |
| This option displays to your LGBTQ peers that you're willing to talk with them, setting yourself apart from the stigma around Christians |  |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [boss], I read the memo about the DEI initiatives and I want to confirm that I'm on board. We might not agree on the methods but if this is how we're going to promote unity then I want to be ready to help open those doors for discussion."
  - Boss: "Thanks for your support. This will be a good team-building move if nothing else."
- **Biblical Reference:** "I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some." - 1 Corinthians 9:22b
- **First Principle:** This option lets you display love and compassion to everybody, regardless of their background. It tears down some of the stigma surrounding Christian involvement in LGBTQ issues if you are willing to set your own pride aside and be flexible for the purpose of building relationships with the people you're trying to reach.

### **Response 3: Push Back on the Initiative Itself**
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| You attack the source of the conflict | Terrible for team-building if anybody in support of the initiative finds out you pushed back |
| Sets a clear boundary | If your request is declined, your reputation with management goes downhill |
| You might be able to fall back on at least getting a personal exemption |  |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Good morning [HR], I saw the memo about the upcoming DEI initiative and I was hoping to push back on it a little bit. Forcing everybody to embrace these values actually does the opposite of the intended effect of inclusion because it excludes people with opposing beliefs."
  - HR: "I hear your concerns and understand where you stand on it, but we've made too much progress to abandon the initiative at this point. We can grant you a personal exception to the requirements if that's how you'd like to proceed."
  - You: "Understood, thank you for your time and consideration."
- **Biblical Reference:** "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery." - Galatians 5:1 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** This option lets you face the issue head-on and gives you a couple options to fall back on. It also carries the most risk of any of the three due to the ramifications of possible failure. This is a viable option if you want to take an active approach instead of a passive approach like the other two.

### My Reponse
As someone who has grown up around several people who have, in the last few years, chosen to transition from male to female or vice versa, I believe that compassion has to be the first priority in interactions with LGBTQ people. Regardless of how they choose to identify themselves, they are still the same person and are still worthy of respect, compassion, and the same love that Jesus shows all of us. If wearing a pin and putting pronouns in your online profile is all it takes to break down any barriers that they might feel about talking with you, then I believe it would be foolish to not wear the pin and use the pronouns. Excluding others on the basis of their sins is not an effective way to reach people who are already broken. I would choose option 2.
