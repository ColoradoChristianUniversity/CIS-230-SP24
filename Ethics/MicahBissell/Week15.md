# Week 15 Ethics Assignment

## Prompt
You are a software engineer working for a marketing firm that has been hired by a tobacco company to analyze data for a new product. Your team is excited to work on this project because it could save your struggling company during a bad economy. However, you suspect the customer is intending the product for young audiences, but you are not sure. To make matters worse, you have been trying to build a relationship with a coworker who has criticized religion as judgmental; you are worried that taking a moral stand against this product could come across as hypocritical and cause you to lose the opportunity to reach him just as he is softening to spiritual conversations. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Possible Responses

### **Response 1: Confront the Customer, Ask About Intention with the Product**
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Stands up for your morals about how such a product should be targeted | Damages relationship with the customer |
| If the customer states the intention is not to target young people, then you can move ahead with a clear conscience knowing you took the right steps | Customer might back out of the deal |
| Might get the customer to reconsider who their target audience is if they are forced to think about it | Your own team might turn against you, blaming you if the customer backs out |
|  | As the prompt suggests, might come across as hypocritical to your coworker |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [customer], I'd love to go ahead and move forward with our data analysis project, but I have to ask- what's the goal with this? What target demographic are you going for?"
  - Customer: "Yeah, we're trying to just expand our market whichever way the data points us to go. Not sure which way that is yet though."
  - You: "Got it, thanks. We'll keep working on it then."
- **Biblical Reference:** "Getting wisdom is the wisest thing you can do! And whatever else you do, develop good judgment." - Proverbs 4:7
- **First Principle:** Going this route lets you gain some more clarity on the situation before acting in a manner that might be perceived as reckless (such as what could be seen in more drastic approaches like quitting outright). It might be slightly abrasive in the context of your relationship with the coworker, but it strikes a good balance between meeting the needs of that relationship with the needs of your own conscience.

### **Response 2: Continue to Work on the Project but Open up to your Coworker**
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Allows you to get the project done | Doesn't address the issue of the product potentially being targeted at children |
| Potentially opens up window for more discussion with coworker | The conversations you have with the coworker will probably be awkward depending on how he views them |
| Doesn't cause conflict with the customer |  |
| Probably does the best job at keeping your company alive |  |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [coworker], what do you think about this product? Does it seem like they're trying to use what we give them to market to kids?"
  - Coworker: "Kind of, yeah. Why do you mention it, is it a religious belief?"
  - You: "It could be called that, but even on a moral level it doesn't feel great. I'd love to talk about it more when you get a chance."
  - Coworker: "Yeah for sure, let's do it."
- **Biblical Reference:** "If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone." - Romans 12:8
- **First Principle:** This is probably the most peaceful option you have. It doesn't ruin any relationships and it hopefully lets you talk to the coworker about a real problem that affects you both. It doesn't do anything to solve the problem of the harmful product being targeted at kids, but this goes hand in hand very well with an attitude of trust in God and His will for the company, the customer, and the product.

### **Response 3: Do the Project Without Talking to the Coworker**
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Cannot possibly come across as hypocritical or passive aggressive to your coworker | Does not stand up for your own morals or conscience |
| Allows you to hopefully help save your company | Doesn't advance your relationship with the coworker |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [customer], just wanted to update you and let you know that the data analysis project is still going full steam ahead."
  - Customer: "Glad to hear it. Looking forward to seeing what you come up with.
- **Biblical Reference:** "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." - Philippians 4:6-7
- **First Principle:** This is an okay path to take if you want to avoid all confrontation- it's very peaceful just like option 2. It can't cause any problems with your coworker so this might be a good choice if you want to wait for a better opportunity to talk with him.

### My Reponse
I would choose response 2. I believe it correctly prioritizes your individual relationship with the coworker, understanding that you have the most control over that situation and thus should relinquish the other situation to God's will. Even if you do clarify the customer's intentions, if you're correct about their desire to market to younger audiences you still don't have a great path forward, you just have more information.
