# Week 9 Ethics Assignment

## Prompt
While writing some code Saturday night, you realize you have introduced a crippling bug that breaks the entire system. As a Christian, you have politely requested no deadlines, meetings or work ever occur on Sunday. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Possible Responses

### **Response 1: Stay Up All Night Saturday to Try and Fix the Code**
| 🟢 Pros | 🔴 Cons |
|-|-|
| You ideally get the work done | You'll be extremely tired on Sunday |
| You still get to take your Sabbath on Sunday | If you don't get it done, you pass on an unfinished product to your teammate in the morning |
| Minimal number of people will be affected as you dealt with it immediately | You might not be at your most productive on Saturday night |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [boss], sorry to disturb you this late on a weekend but I just found out that I made a pretty big mistake while writing code. I would like to keep my Sunday free as I've requested before but I'll be up late tonight working on fixing it."
  - Boss: "Understood. Keep me posted, and in return I'll do what I can to keep you free tomorrow."
- **Biblical Reference:** "There are six days when you may work, but the seventh day is a day of sabbath rest, a day of sacred assembly. You are not to do any work; wherever you live, it is a sabbath to the Lord." - Leviticus 23:3 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** If you are consistent about keeping the Sabbath as a principle of your faith, you should strive to continue to keep it even if it means making some sacrifices the night before. You may be tired, but being able to both fix the problem and keep your Sabbath might be worth it for you.

### **Response 2: Do Nothing on Saturday, Keep your Sabbath on Sunday if Approved**
| 🟢 Pros | 🔴 Cons |
|-|-|
| You keep your Sabbath | You don't solve the problem that you caused |
| You won't be tired going into the new week | Your boss and teammates will likely be angry/disappointed with you because you're forcing the work on them |
|  | Your conscience shouldn't be clear after making this choice |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [boss], sorry to disturb you this late on a weekend but I just found out that I made a pretty big mistake while writing code. I wanted to let you know now so you can get someone on that as fast as possible."
  - Boss: "I know you requested Sundays off, and I'll give it to you this time because of your faith, but this isn't okay. Your team is going to be mad at me now and I hope you know they'll be mad at you too on Monday."
  - You: "I understand. I just won't be at the top of my game if I try and fix it tonight."
- **Biblical Reference:** "Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 10 but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns." - Exodus 20:9-10
- **First Principle:** This is a viable choice if you are outspoken about your faith and its effects on your daily life in the context of your work. In this scenario, your boss and team might be understanding of the circumstances. They still might be frustrated with you, and they'd be well within their rights to be mad, but you would uphold your faith and values in the process.
