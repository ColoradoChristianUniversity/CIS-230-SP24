# Week 9 Ethics Assignment

## Prompt
While writing some code Saturday night, you realize you have introduced a crippling bug that breaks the entire system. As a Christian, you have politely requested no deadlines, meetings or work ever occur on Sunday. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Possible Responses

### **Response 1: Stay Up All Night Saturday to Try and Fix the Code**
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| You ideally get the work done | You'll be extremely tired on Sunday |
| You still get to take your Sabbath on Sunday | If you don't get it done, you pass on an unfinished product to your teammate in the morning |
| Minimal number of people will be affected as you dealt with it immediately | You might not be at your most productive on Saturday night |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [boss], sorry to disturb you this late on a weekend but I just found out that I made a pretty big mistake while writing code. I would like to keep my Sunday free as I've requested before but I'll be up late tonight working on fixing it."
  - Boss: "Understood. Keep me posted, and in return I'll do what I can to keep you free tomorrow."
- **Biblical Reference:** "There are six days when you may work, but the seventh day is a day of sabbath rest, a day of sacred assembly. You are not to do any work; wherever you live, it is a sabbath to the Lord." - Leviticus 23:3 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** If you are consistent about keeping the Sabbath as a principle of your faith, you should strive to continue to keep it even if it means making some sacrifices the night before. You may be tired, but being able to both fix the problem and keep your Sabbath might be worth it for you.
