# Week 9 Ethics Assignment

## Prompt
While writing some code Saturday night, you realize you have introduced a crippling bug that breaks the entire system. As a Christian, you have politely requested no deadlines, meetings or work ever occur on Sunday. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Possible Responses

### **Response 1: Stay Up All Night Saturday to Try and Fix the Code**
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| You ideally get the work done | You'll be extremely tired on Sunday |
| You still get to take your Sabbath on Sunday | If you don't get it done, you pass on an unfinished product to your teammate in the morning |
| Minimal number of people will be affected as you dealt with it immediately | You might not be at your most productive on Saturday night |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [boss], sorry to disturb you this late on a weekend but I just found out that I made a pretty big mistake while writing code. I would like to keep my Sunday free as I've requested before but I'll be up late tonight working on fixing it."
  - Boss: "Understood. Keep me posted, and in return I'll do what I can to keep you free tomorrow."
- **Biblical Reference:** "There are six days when you may work, but the seventh day is a day of sabbath rest, a day of sacred assembly. You are not to do any work; wherever you live, it is a sabbath to the Lord." - Leviticus 23:3 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** If you are consistent about keeping the Sabbath as a principle of your faith, you should strive to continue to keep it even if it means making some sacrifices the night before. You may be tired, but being able to both fix the problem and keep your Sabbath might be worth it for you.

### **Response 2: Do Nothing on Saturday, Keep your Sabbath on Sunday if Approved**
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| You keep your Sabbath | You don't solve the problem that you caused |
| You won't be tired going into the new week | Your boss and teammates will likely be angry/disappointed with you because you're forcing the work on them |
|  | Your conscience shouldn't be clear after making this choice |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [boss], sorry to disturb you this late on a weekend but I just found out that I made a pretty big mistake while writing code. I wanted to let you know now so you can get someone on that as fast as possible."
  - Boss: "I know you requested Sundays off, and I'll give it to you this time because of your faith, but this isn't okay. Your team is going to be mad at me now and I hope you know they'll be mad at you too on Monday."
  - You: "I understand. I just won't be at the top of my game if I try and fix it tonight."
- **Biblical Reference:** "Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 10 but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns." - Exodus 20:9-10 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** This is a viable choice if you are outspoken about your faith and its effects on your daily life in the context of your work. In this scenario, your boss and team might be understanding of the circumstances. They still might be frustrated with you, and they'd be well within their rights to be mad, but you would uphold your faith and values in the process.

### **Response 3: Ignore the Sabbath, Fix the Code on Sunday**
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| You get the job done, fixing the problem you caused | You ignore your traditional Sabbath |
| You don't have to lose any sleep at night Saturday or Sunday | This isn't an immediate solution to the problem, potentially causing problems for users on Saturday night and Sunday morning |
| You avoid conflict with your team/boss | You don't get the rest on Sunday that you usually would, potentially reducing productivity the following day |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [boss], sorry to disturb you this late on a weekend but I just found out that I made a pretty big mistake while writing code. I wanted to let you know that I'm going to forego my usual Sabbath tomorrow and fix it so I'm not throwing you and the rest of the team under the bus."
  - Boss: "Got it. Appreciate the flexibility, just make sure you get this done ASAP."
- **Biblical Reference:** "Then he asked them, 'If one of you has a child or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull it out?'" - Luke 14:5 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** This is a good option if you prioritize pulling your own weight on the team and fixing your own problems over taking your regular Sabbath. When it comes to placing priorities in your faith, it can be challenging, but this choice also acknowledges that you're not technically in control of the outcome, having only "politely requested" days off on Sunday. This option is likely the one that makes your boss happiest because it shows ownership of the problem and attacks it in an efficient manner without causing yourself to lose a night of sleep.

### My Reponse
I would personally choose option 1, staying up late on Saturday and attempting to fix it. I think this option shows a good balance between getting the job done efficiently and holding steadfast to your belief in a Sunday Sabbath. It may not be quite as efficient for the company as option 3, as your work output may not be as strong on little/no rest, but if all goes well, you at least turn over a working product to the team on Sunday morning and still get to keep your own Sabbath.
