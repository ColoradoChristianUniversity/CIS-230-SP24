# Week 11 Ethics Assignment

## Prompt
While working for the government, you are asked to solve a seemingly impossible problem in 2 months. You find a third-party software that can do it, but procurement takes 6 months at a minimum. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Possible Responses

### **Response 1: Try to Escalate the Problem, Accepting that you can't Solve the Problem in 2 Months**
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Likely your best shot of solving the problem within the given timeframe of 2 months | You don't get to finish the job assigned to you |
| Shows humility and a teamwork-oriented personality | Pushes your problem onto somebody else who also has work to do |
| Don't have to go through the procurement process for the third party software | Your higher ups may see this as a failure on your part |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [boss], I was looking over this problem and I genuinely don't see any way I can fix this in the two months I've been given. There's some software out there but it'll take several more months to get it than I have. I'd like to push this back up to [executive] if possible because I think he'll be more efficient on this job."
  - Boss: "No problem. He's not going to be super happy about it but if you're sure you can't get it done in time we want to escalate it."
  - You: "Thank you."
- **Biblical Reference:** "Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them bring every difficult case to you; the simple cases they can decide themselves. That will make your load lighter, because they will share it with you." - Exodus 18:22 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** This is likely the most efficient way to solve the problem, which might be your highest priority in this situation. If that is the case, then you should make this choice even if it might reflect somewhat poorly on you personally.

### **Response 2: Go Through the Procurement Process**
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| You solve the difficult problem | You run a time overage of several months |
| You have the software available moving forward in case you run into something similar in the future | Your solution may even become outdated in the time it takes to find it |
| Shows your higher ups that you're capable of solving more intense problems | Keeps you focused on this even while the rest of your team's priorities will likely have shifted |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [boss], I was looking over this problem and I genuinely don't see any way I can fix this in the two months I've been given. There's some software out there but it'll take several more months to get it than I've been given. I'd like to go through the process of getting the software even though it'll take a while because I think we should prioritize solving this problem and preventing it from happening again in the future."
  - Boss: "Fair enough. You're going to be stuck on this project for a while though, are you sure this is the best way?"
  - You: "It's definitely the quickest way I can get it done on my own. Thanks for the understanding."
- **Biblical Reference:** "Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything." - James 1:4 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** This is the best way to get the job done on your own without consulting outside sources. If you're working with limited resources and/or you don't have any other similar commitments that you'd be taking away from over the next few months, you can absolutely feel confident in picking this option.

### **Response 3: Try and Expedite Procurement**
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| If it works, you both get the job done and stay within the timeframe | Higher cost of resources |
| You'll have the software available for future use if similar problems arise | Could strain relationship with the owner of the software |
| If this fails, you can always fall back on either of the other options |  |
- **Dialog:**
  - You: "Hey [boss], I was looking over this problem and I think the only way I can get it fixed within the next two months is if we expedite the procurement of this software I found. Can we get that ball rolling?"
  - Boss: "Yeah absolutely. Glad you were able to find a way to make this work."
- **Biblical Reference:** "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving." - Colossians 3:23-24 (NIV)
- **First Principle:** This is the best choice from almost every standpoint except pure resource cost, and even that can be argued as you save 4+ months in this scenario. It's efficient, it keeps the situation within your own control, and if it fails for any reason you can then backpedal to either of the other two choices. It's the best first approach assuming you have the resources available to do it.

### My Reponse
I would absolutely choose option 3, trying to expedite procurement of the software. It costs a little bit more up front to go this route, but I believe it's highly likely that that cost will be made up for by both the 4 months I'll be able to spend working on something else and also the fact that we won't have the problem in our system for those 4 months. If expediting the software does fail for any reason, I would likely fall back on option 2 and wait out the rest of the 6 month process rather than try and escalate the situation to people who weren't involved in the expedition attempt.
