 ➖ Boss: (Email) Hey, I heard that there was a bug.

 ➖ Me: Yeah there is a bug that is affecting the breaking of the system. I am prioritizing the speed of fixing the bug as well as the quality of the fix and I plan on working on it tomorrow (Sunday) as well until it is resolved. 

 ➖ Boss: Sounds like you understand the gravity and have a plan of action regarding the fix. Let me know if you need anything. 

 ➖ Me: Will do!

|**🟢Pros**    | **🔴Cons** |
|Shows that you care and want to fix the issue even though it is on a Sunday.| You might have some conflicted feelings regarding personal beliefs about Sunday.|
|Other colleagues who work on Sunday can help you.| People who are working Sunday are going to be annoyed that they have to help you, instead of doing their job. |

 ➖ Me: Hey boss, last night we had a bug affect the system and I need assistance from colleagues. 

 ➖ Boss: Is it something that can wait until Monday?

 ➖ Me: I believe it needs to be addressed sooner rather than later and some help would help get it done sooner rather than later. 

 ➖ Boss: Okay, just get it figured out.

## Option 3: Fix it enough

|**🟢Pros**    | **🔴Cons** |
|Addresses major issues and prevents more damage.|Over Sunday more bugs could be introduced.| 
|Tempory fix for you so you do not have to work on Sunday|Might make it a living hell for coworkers/ you on Monday.|

 **🎭Script**

 ➖ Boss: (Email Saturday) How is it going?

 ➖ Me: (Email) It is going well, however, there has been quite the issue, there seems to be a bug in the code that could potentially be bad. 

 ➖ Boss: Oh that does not sound good, can you fix it tonight?

 ➖ Me: I have been trying to fix it for a while now, and I should be able to contain the issue for now, but I also want to maintain my commitment to not work on Sunday.

 ➖ Boss: As long as it is stable enough to make it till Monday without getting worse I'll allow it. 

  
**📙Scripture**
> Proverbs 27:23-24 NIV
Be sure you know the condition of your flocks, and give careful attention to your herds; for riches do not endure forever and a crown is not secure for all generations.

**👍First Principle**
> Personal boundaries are important but so are communication and setting realistic expectations.

## My Choice

**🤙** I would choose option 1: let the boss know and then deal with it ASAP. It was a big mistake by showing the boss that you accept the responsibility for you mistake and are willing to forego your pre-established desire to not work on Sunday.
