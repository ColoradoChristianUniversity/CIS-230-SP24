 **🎭Script**

 ➖ Boss: (Email): Put your pronouns and wear the 🌈 pin on Thursday!

 ➖ Me: (Email just to boss): Hey there, I do not feel comfortable doing either of those due to my religion, but I am willing to compromise, and I will put my pronouns in for the time being. 

 ➖ Boss: I appreciate the willingness and I see your point, if your actions align with the value of respect that we foster at this company I will accept the compromise.

 ➖ Me: Thank you.

## Option 2: Email back and say respectfully, no.

|--------- | ------- |
|**🟢Pros**    | **🔴Cons** |
|My beliefs are expressed and there is no compromising my integrity. |Easily could be led to tension with HR or colleagues who care about inclusivity. |
|Very easy to start a conversation about why I am not participating as everyone can see that I have not done either. | Could damage my reputation. |

 ➖ Boss: Oh? why?

  ➖ Me: It goes against my personal beliefs, and I just cannot sacrifice my beliefs.

   ➖ Boss: Okay, well I understand your perspective, but this is an important company culture so maybe we can come to some common ground.

## My Choice

**🤙** Honestly this is a hard choice. While option 2 would be my preferred choice. I would probably go with Option 1. At least it is a compromise. 

My biggest issue with showing my pronouns and wearing the pin is it shows that I accept when I really do not. So, I suppose the best choice would be to do one of them. 

While choice 2 would be my favorite option, I could be more willing to show my pronouns. It to me is less of a big deal as it is only with emails. Whereas wearing the pin is a show of visible acceptance.
