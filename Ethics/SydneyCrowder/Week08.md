# Ethics Week 8

## Question ❔❔❔
While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he is up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

### Disregard it and let what's going to happen, happen
**🟢Pros**

 ➖ You don't have to worry about talking to your teammate or the boss.

 ➖ You are not in the middle of anything. 

 **🔴Cons**

**📙Scripture**
> Proverbs 3:5-6

## My Choice

**🤙**
While it would be easiest to do option #3, I think I would do option #2.

This would be the best choice because I imagine after 6 months of mentoring my teammate, we would be close, which would make it easier to give my opinion specifically since I am the one helping him understand.
