# Week 5 Ethics

# Option 1: Say nothing and grade it accordingly: good code = good grade. 
游릴 Pros:
- I do not have to deal with my reputation as a teacher being "mean." 
- Not seen as a teacher who overreacts. 
- Get a reputation for being 'chill.'


游린 Cons:
- Not fair to the non-cheating students. 
- I get taken advantage of.
- Students don't learn. If students think they can get away with cheating, they will cheat every time. 


游꿠 Script: 

Me: Good job with the assignment.

Student: Thanks.


游닀 Scripture: Proverbs 10:9 (NIV)
- "Whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out. 

游뱂 First principle: 
- Actions have consequences. While it might take a while before the actions are found out, everything is brought to light at some point. 

# Option 2: Contact the student to see if they own up to it. (They do)
游릴 Pros: 
- I allow the student to own up and apologize. 
- Student gets a 'warning' and I am seen as a teacher who won't put up with cheating but allows coming clean without affecting grades.


游린 Cons:
- I could be taken advantage of because students realize all they have to do is come clean and apologize to get points. (Whether they mean it or not)
- The student who cheats does not get punished thus not preparing them for the real world. 
- Students who don't cheat and get a worse grade could feel tempted to cheat in the future.

游꿠 Script:

Me: Hey, I was wondering if you had any trouble or anything with the past assignment?

Student: Yeah, I ended up looking up a tutorial of some code and using it. 

Me: Okay, well thanks for coming clean but as you know the school is very clear on plagiarism and I gave a lecture on it last time.

Student: Yeah I am so sorry, I was very overwhelmed and did not know where to start.

Me: Okay, I will let you off with a warning this time but don't let it happen again. 


游닀 Scripture: Proverbs 19:11  (NIV)
- "A person's wisdom yields patience; it is to one's glory to overlook an offense."

游뱂 First principle:
- Students might cheat due to pressure or lack of understanding thus it is important to show compassion and understanding

# Option 3: Contact the student and university informing them both of the cheating that has occurred. 
游릴 Pros:
- I keep it fair to other students by abiding by the University rules of cheating. 
- I am seen as a 'black and white' professor, who does not put up with cheating.


游린 Cons:
- I am seen as extreme/ disliked.
- I have a reputation for overreacting. 

游꿠 Script:

Me: (email) Hi (university person who deals with this) my student submitted an assignment that was directly copied off of a tutorial they found online. I am CC'ing them in this email so you will have their information to take care of the issue at hand. Thank you - Professor C

University: Thank you, Professor C, we will take of it. 


游닀 Scripture: Proverbs 12:22 (NIV)
- " The Lord destest lying lips, but he delights in people who are trustworthy."


游뱂 First principle:
- It is important to elevate learning and justice when teaching. If students get away with cheating then there is no justice for the students who don't cheat thus no learning. 


# I would choose the secord option.
It gives the student to come clean.
