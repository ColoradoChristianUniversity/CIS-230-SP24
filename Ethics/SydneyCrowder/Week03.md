# This is week 3 

## Option 1: Decline 
Pros:
- Maintain user privacy/trust
- Avoids legal consequences

Cons:
- Could negatively affect public relations
- Law enforcement relationships might be affected

Dialog
- Authorities: We need you to create a backdoor so we can gather evidence for online child trafficking schemes. 
- Me: No, that violates user privacy and trust.
- Authorities: Wow okay. We will remember you...
- Me: Sorry not sorry.

Scripture: Proverbs 11:3 - ESV
- "The integrity of the upright guides them, but the crookedness of the treacherous destroys them." 

First Principal: It is important to stand up for what is right, even if that means going against larger forces.

## Option 2: Accept but must do it legally
Pros:
- Done legally so there is no weight on you.
- Your integrity is maintained.

Cons:
- There could be some privacy concerns from users, but it is done legally.
- The backdoor could be misused by others.

Dialog
- Authorities: We need you to create a backdoor so we can gather evidence for online child trafficking schemes
- Me: I can do that, but it has to be done legally.
- Authorities: ugh fine.... (makes it legal)
- Me: All right, here is your backdoor.

Scripture: Romans 13:1 - ESV
- "Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except God, and those that exist have been instituted by God."
 
First Principal: It is important to prioritize legal compliance and due process all while being committed to cooperate with authorities within the borders of law. 

## Option 3: Accept.
Pros:
- Possibly saving the lives of children.
- Law enforcement relationships are improved.

Cons:
- Could end up with a lack of trust and privacy with users
- Backdoor could be misused
- Could be sued? (I do not know enough but seems like it could be possible.)

Dialog
- Authorities: We need you to create a backdoor so we can gather evidence for online child trafficking schemes
- Me: Absolutely. Here you go.
- Authorities: Cool. Thanks.

Scripture: Proverbs 22:1 - ESV
- "A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches, and favor is better than silver or gold."

First Principal: Collaboration with authorities to protect others must continue to be a top priority. 

# My Choice
I would choose option #2. It integrates the best of both options. I keep myself out of legal trouble because it was done legally from both parties. In addition, my morals are not compromised.
