## Marek Schroyer
#### ➖ Option 1 - Fail the Student
- Harsh
- Followed the academic policy perfectly
#### ➖ Option 2 - Failed Specific Assignment
- Student has the chance to redeem themselves
- Could be seen as too soft.
#### ➖ Option 3 - Let Dean Decide the fate of the student
- Decision is out of your hands
- Could be seen as harsh and uncaring to students

## My Choice
Using only the options that Marek and Jewels created. I would choose Marek's option 2. 
- Fail the student on the specific assignment. 

I think that it is the best choice because it allows the student to come clean, but also expresses that plagiarism will not be tolerated. It is like a strike system. This is their first strike and the next time they plagiarize then it is going to be taken much more seriously.
#### Why I agree with Marek
- I agree with Marek because it shows the student that you check and know that they plagiarize. In addition, it won't be tolerated. 
#### Why I don't agree with Jewels
I don't agree with Jewels Option #3. I think that it is very lenient. Specifically, because there had just been a lecture on the importance of not plagiarizing.
