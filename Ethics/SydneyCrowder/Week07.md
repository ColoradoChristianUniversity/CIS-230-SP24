# Question
A junior engineer at your company, leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence, has completed a critical software project well ahead of schedule. The AI has written almost the entire application, raising questions about the engineer's understanding of the project's intricacies. Despite this, the company's management, impressed by the speedy delivery, is planning to integrate this AI-generated software into major systems immediately. You are concerned but you are also friends with this junior developer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


# Answers

## Option 1: Nice Job!  
**游릴 Pros:**

 - Still friends with the junior developer.
 - Due to the speedy delivery, I can focus on another project. 

**游린 Cons:**

 - Could have many serious flaws that could be detrimental to the project.
 - My junior friend could get fired if it fails.

**游꿠 Script:**

 - Me: Hey, nice job finishing that project so efficiently.

**游뱂 First principle:**
It is important to acknowledge the effort while expressing concerns about potential risks.

## Option 2: Looks good, but this could be bad.
**游릴 Pros:**

 - Maintains friendship.
 - Let the junior developer know that he better know if it works.
 - Questions his knowledge without trying to be rude or looking down on him.

**游린 Cons:**

 - Junior could take it the wrong way and think I am being rude.
 - Junior could also think that I am trying to get him in trouble.

**游꿠 Script:**

 - Me: Hey, I was hoping to talk to you about the AI-generated software that you did.
 - Junior: Oh yeah! I am so glad I did that so we could focus on other projects!
 - Me: Yeah... here is the deal though. I am concerned that you did that and you don't know what you submitted or how it works. That could lead to major damage to our application.
 - Junior: Oh... yeah, I mean I trust the AI and it should be fine. I mean what is the worst that could happen?

**游닀 Scripture:**

> Proverbs 12:15(NIV) "The way of fools seems right to them, but the wise listen to advice."

**游뱂 First principle:**
If you prioritize honesty and transparency in expressing concerns, then you aid in protecting the project and the developer.

## Option 3: That is a very bad idea. 
**游릴 Pros:**

 - I let Junior know that it is a very bad idea that he used AI-generated code for the software if he does not know how it works.
 - Junior understands the gravity of the situation
 - Junior gets an eye-opener understanding that he was hired because he supposedly understands the code and if he can't confirm the code then he is not qualified and could lose his job.

**游린 Cons:**

 - Junior thinks I am jealous and stops being friends with me.
 - Junior does not take the criticism seriously and the software crashes, the company goes to him, and he does not know what to do thus being fired.

**游꿠 Script:**

 - Me: Hey Junior, I think that it is a bad idea that you submitted AI-generated code specifically if you don't know what it does.
 - Junior: Oh, nah, it will be fine but thanks for the concern.
 - Me: Okay, I recommend that you brush up on that code and you understand what it does in case it crashes and everyone turns to you.
 - Junior: You know, I will. Thanks for the advice.

**游닀 Scripture:**

> Proverbs 15:22 (NIV) "Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succed."

**游뱂 First principle:**
It is important to place understanding and accountability in the development of software to reduce potential risks.


## My Choice
I would choose option 3. While it could be harsh to hear, I can at least say I tried to warn you (Junior) thus it is up to him what he does with my advice.
