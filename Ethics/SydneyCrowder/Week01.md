# My Choice
With the options listed above, I would choose option #3: Ask the boss to give the job to someone else. This option allows for the boss to both understand why I don’t feel good about taking the job and then he can give the job to someone else who doesn’t have the moral restrictions.
- However, if the boss refuses and I have to do it, then I would have to reconsider the other two options.
