# 3 Answers 🛠️


## Option 1: Confront the Senior Pastor 

|     |    |
|--------- | ------- |
|**🟢Pros** | **🔴Cons** |
|Forces accountability with the pastor. |Could strain the relationship between me and the pastor. |
| Allows pastor to come forward and explain why. |The pastor could feel attacked which leads to retaliating ||||

 **🎭Script**
 ➖ Me: Hey there, Bob, while I was fixing the computers I noticed that you are not giving anything to the church. Is there a reason?
 ➖ Bob (senior pastor): Oh, I did not know you had access and that was visible. I do not want to talk about it. 
 ➖ Me: Yes, there are a few people who can see the records. But as a leader in the church who speaks to the congregation about tithing, I just wanted to understand why you do not.
 ➖ Bob (senior pastor): It is personal, and I am not going to discuss it with you. 
 
**📙Scripture**
> 1 Timothy 5:19 NIV 
- Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses.

**👍First Principle**
> There needs to be accountability and transparency within church leadership, but there are biblical principles that should be followed when approaching a matter. 

## Option 2: Talk to another leader (pastor, elder, etc.)

|     |    |
|--------- | ------- |
|**🟢Pros** | **🔴Cons** |
|Allows guidance and gets another perspective for addressing the issue. |The other person might not see it as that big of an issue. |
|Maintains the relationship between me and the senior pastor while addressing the concern. |Might lead to rumors or gossip in the church. |
|||

 **🎭Script**
 ➖ Me (to some other leader): Hey I wanted to talk to you about Bob, while I was working with the giving records, I noticed that he is not listed as giving anything. 
 ➖ Another leader: Oh? I will investigate that and make sure that you are not missing him, but if this is correct then we will figure out what to do to move forward.
 ➖ Me: Okay, thanks!
 
**📙Scripture**
> Galatians 6:1 NIV
- Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted.
**👍First Principle**
> It is important to seek advice and guidance from others before acting while prioritizing fixing the problem in a gentle way. 
## Option 3: Pray, Wait, and Contemplate. 
 
|     |    |
|--------- | ------- |
|**🟢Pros** | **🔴Cons** |
|Gives me time for prayer and discernment. |Could just continue without resolution. | 
|Helps maintain relationships with the pastor and others in the church. |If it is found that I knew about it and never said anything, it could come back to get me. |
| ||
 **🎭Script**
 ➖ Me (In prayer): Lord, I have learned about Bob not giving anything to the church and it causes me to worry. Please guide me in what to do with this situation and how to move forward.
 ➖ Me (Afterwards): I must continue to pray about this and give it some time before I take any action.
 
**📙Scripture**
> Proverbs 3:5-6 NIV
-Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.

**👍First Principle**
> Trusting in God and his timing can help ease your mind and give you discernment before acting.


## My Choice
**🤙** 
Honestly, I feel like in this example I would do all these options. I would pray then go to another leader, then finally go to the senior pastor himself. 

But for the sake of this assignment of choosing one, I would just go to the Senior Pastor. Who knows it could just be a misunderstanding and he is giving under a different name.
