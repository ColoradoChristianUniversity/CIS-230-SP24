# Week 02 Ethics
First Response (For laying off workers)
Bible Verse: Proverbs 13:4 - The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing, while the soul of the diligent is richly supplied.
Pros:
* Greater efficiency
* Greater customer turnover
* No more wages
Cons: 
* No human touch
* 175 people losing their jobs
* Depreciation of machinery value over time
Dialogue:
Boss - I'm assigning you to a project to develop a machine learning software so our customer can improve their customer's learning and cut back on costs.
Jaxson - Alright, will this result in job cuts at their company?
Boss - Yes, they plan to lay off 175 people after we get them the product.
Jaxson - But what about all those people that are going to get laid off?
Boss - I don't pay you to ask about what's right and wrong, I pay you to work.
Jaxson - Yes sir.
First Principle: It is not a hill I would die on; the people will find other jobs.



Second Response (Against laying off workers)
Bible Verse: Ephesians 5:15-16 - Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men, but as wise, making the most of your time.
Pros:
* I won't be the reason people lose their jobs
* I can hopefully get them to keep their jobs at least for a little longer
Cons: 
* I might lose my job depending on the boss
* People might still lose their jobs if someone else completes this work
Dialogue:
Boss - I'm assigning you to a project to develop a machine learning software so our customer can improve their customer's learning and cut back on costs.
Jaxson - Alright, will this result in job cuts at their company?
Boss - Yes, they plan to lay off 175 people after we get them the product.
Jaxson - I refuse to do work that's going to cost so many people their livelihood.
Boss - Then you're fired. Pack up your stuff and get out.
Jaxson - Fine.
First Principle: It is a hill I will die on; I refuse to do work that will be detrimental to so many people.



Third Response (In between)
Bible Verse: Ephesians 5:15-16 - Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men, but as wise, making the most of your time.
Pros:
* I can try and help both the company and the people who will get laid off
* Hopefully they will go to a company that values them more
Cons: 
* It will cost me time
* They will still get fired
Dialogue:
Boss - I'm assigning you to a project to develop a machine learning software so our customer can improve their customer's learning and cut back on costs.
Jaxson - Alright, will this result in job cuts at their company?
Boss - Yes, they plan to lay off 175 people after we get them the product.
Jaxson - I will only work on this project if our customer helps the laid off workers find new jobs.
Boss - What? Why do you care about the laid off workers?
Jaxson - Because I care about people, and I don't want a bunch of people to be thrown out on the street just because our customer wants to cut back on costs a little.
Boss - Fine, I'll try to see what I can do, but I can't promise you anything. 
Jaxson - Thank you, I'll get to work in the meantime.
First Principle: It isn't a hill I would die on, but I still care about people enough to stick my neck out a little to try and do some good.



Personal Choice (Third Response)
Personally, I would go with the third response as it is not a hill, I would be willing to die on, however, if at all possible, I would like to try and help the workers that are getting laid off. I also think the dialogue in the third one is reasonable.
