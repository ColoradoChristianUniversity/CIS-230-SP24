# Week _ Ethics Response
## Question:
You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets. The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until put under the scrutiny of your tool. They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better secularize public places. You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years. The product manager speculates it could potentially be licensed to foreign governments in the future wanting to accomplish similar goals. However, you also have misgivings. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

### Answers
## Option 1: Build Huge Bugs in the system that ignore Christianity
| Pros | Cons |
|-|-|
| Would mean you are doing kingdom work by removing roadblocks | Would be pretty dang easy to spot after a while |
| Would be an awesome story to tell your grandkids | Would not establish the best views of Christianity in other people’s eyes (going behind the soft) |
| Would be quite impressive if you could pull it off | Would also more than likely result in you getting arrested |

#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Isaiah 55:8-9 - “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,” declares the Lord. “As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.

__*Principle*__ - The work of man and your employees is to be respected and treated properly, but it is still behind the work of the Lord and His will. 

#### Script
- Employer: You got that code all lined up for the detection software?
- You: Yeah, just need to get this last commit in there *winks*
- Employer: Who are you winking at? 
- You: Ah, no one, just a weird twitch I guess...

## Option 2: Protest the work and refuse to work on it
| Pros | Cons |
|-|-|
| You are standing up for the rights you have as an American citizen | Some people may take that as hostility |
| You publicly declaring that tearing down religions does not belong to private enterprise | Refusing to work on this could mean you loose your job |

#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    1st Peter 3:15 - But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect

__*Principle*__ - Living in the US, we have the freedom of religion in our rights and we should be able to exercise that right in public. The government should have no say in how this tool is implemented. 

#### Script
- Employer: You got that code all lined up for the detection software?
- You: Yeah, it's almost done. But I don't know if I am comfortable finishing it...
- Employer: Why not? Isn't this something that you have been striving to accomplish for a while now?
- You: Yes, but I cannot do it knowing what it is going to be used for...

## Option 3: Let the government use it how they want
| Pros | Cons |
|-|-|
| You get to see your life-long project being used | It is for reasons you don't agree with at all |
| You will probably get paid a good amount of money for implementing it properly | This system could be used very oppressively and cause major problems for cultures outside of the US that do not have the same freedoms as we do |

#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Romans 13:1-2 - Obey the government, for God is the One who has put it there. There is no government anywhere that God has not placed in power. So those who refuse to obey the law of the land are refusing to obey God, and punishment will follow.

__*Principle*__ - God does tell us that the governments that are in place are put there by His hand, so maybe the increase in persecution is something that God intended to happen. 

#### Script
- Employer: You got that code all lined up for the detection software?
- You: Yup, this is my pride and joy! I am grateful to finally have a buyer lined up

## Conclusion
Even through the increases of machine learning and technological bounds, the kingdom of God cannot be stopped by something that man creates. Sure, it may halt the progress that we have made or even make it harder like in this case. But I don't think that this would cause any detriment in the long run. 
## My Final Choice
With that being said, I would still take option 2 and not finish the project. Even though it was my life's ambition, I would rather see it in the right hands than being used to oppress people and limit their freedoms.
