# Week 2 Ethics Response
## Question:
While working as an engineer at a consultancy firm, you are assigned a project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
## Answers
### Option 1: Complete the Assigned Project
#### Pros
- Gets the work for your company done and shows that you are responsible towards your client and their needs. 
- The client will likely return with more work if they need it because they know your firm gets things done.
- This makes the client more productive. 
#### Cons
- Shows that your company is morally fine with treading on grey lines that interrupt other people and their flow of life.
- You have to live with the fact you designed something that lost 175 people their jobs. 
#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Deuteronomy 8:18 - You may say to yourself, “My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me.” But remember the Lord your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth, and so confirms his covenant, which he swore to your ancestors, as it is today.
__*Principle*__ - The Lord can open and close doors in people's lives very easily, and sometimes we have to be confident in pursuing the right reasons for why we make decisions. Sometimes that might mean closing doors for other people inadvertently. 
#### Script
- Boss: Hey, can you get this machine learning project started for client A?
- Me: Is this the one that is going to cause a huge layoff within their firm?
- Boss: Yeah, that's that one.
- Me: I'll get working on it right away!

### Option 2: Research if there is a way to minimize layoffs and still increase productivity
#### Pros
- It's an attempt to make everyone happy, where productivity is still increased and people can keep their jobs
#### Cons
- not everyone can be retained, so some let-go's are still going to happen. 
- This could result in a disastrous misuse of your own companies resources if there is no solution to solving both. 
#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Ephesians 4:32 - Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you
__*Principle*__ - Wanting to do your job is one thing, but knowing that your project is the reason that 175 other people lost their own job is quite a burden to bear. Doing your best to at least help some of the clients employees out is not a bad thing, but you would have to make sure that you are still helping them increase their performance. This means you would have to make a case to them justifying keeping more employees. 
#### Script
- Boss: Hey, can you get this machine learning project started for client A?
- Me: Is this the one that is going to cause a huge layoff within their firm?
- Boss: Yeah, that's that one.
- Me: Yeah, I can, but can I look into the current project plan? I think that releasing that many employees would severely harm their productivity, and I want to make another snapshot of what the project would look like if they retained some of those employees. 
- Boss: Sure, just don't let that get you behind on the deadline. I want that proposal on my desk by tomorrow!

### Option 3: Deny the work out of moral reasons
#### Pros
- You don't have to have the loss of all the clients employees on your mind
#### Cons
- This creates more trouble for your firm, as now they have to find someone else to do the project. 
- You could lose your job by denying this project.
- Your firm could 
#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Matthew 7:12 - So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.
__*Principle*__ - I certainly would not like to have my job taken from me because my company found a way to become more efficient. Also knowing that someone out there was responsible for making the machine learning that lost me my job would not make me very happy. 
#### Script
- Boss: Hey, can you get this machine learning project started for client A?
- Me: Is this the one that is going to cause a huge layoff within their firm?
- Boss: Yeah, that's that one.
- Me: Boss, I don't know if I feel comfortable making that call for the client...
- Boss: Can I see you in my office for a second please?

## Conclusion
This is quite the dilemma. On the one hand, as a business you always want to be pursuing the best ways to make efficiency a staple in your workplace. God calls us to do that by being efficient and purposeful with what he has given us in parables like Matthew 25. But we also want to be kind to those around us and lift them up as best we can. So, we have come to the choice of helping the client or the employees of the client. 
## My Final Choice
I want to say that taking number 2 is my first choice, but I don't think that it is feasible as an answer. Knowing that so much research already goes into the project scopes for clients like this, I think that the best result is to complete the project as requested. I know that it seems rather heartless, but I do think that God would open the right doors for those that lost their jobs and use this to strengthen them.
