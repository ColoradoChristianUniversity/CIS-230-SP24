# Week 9 Ethics Response
## Question:
While writing some code Saturday night, you realize you have introduced a crippling bug that breaks the entire system. As a Christian, you have politely requested no deadlines, meetings or work ever occur on Sunday. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

### Answers
## Option 1: Take the Sabbath
| Pros | Cons |
|-|-|
| You respect your spiritual life by taking the Sabbath | That restful day could be filled with anxiety about the coming issue you have to face |
| You have a restful day with no work | If the bug is in the launch code, your team will not be very happy with you |
|  | Your boss would be very unhappy with you not getting the work that was needed done |

#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Isaiah 58:13-14 - If you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath and from doing as you please on my holy day, if you call the Sabbath a delight and the Lord's holy day honorable, and if you honor it by not going your own way and not doing as you please or speaking idle words, then you will find your joy in the Lord.

__*Principle*__ -  You would still communicate that you are not going to be able to address the work until Monday, you wouldn't just leave your team in the dark. But respecting your spiritual disciplines is something that needs to be appreciated more, even if it could come at the expense of work. As someone who does not have an official Sabbath, I would not take this option. 

#### Script
- You: Hey boss, I know that this project needs to get done by Tuesday, and that we need to have our branches done by Monday morning, but I can't do any of my work on Sunday for religious reasons.
- Boss: Ok, what’s the problem with having it done tonight? You are usually pretty good about getting your repos ready on Saturdays anyways...
- You: Well, my last additions broke the build...
- Boss: So you're going to fix it right?
- You: I don't want to infringe on my Sabbath, so I am not going to work on the code till Monday...
- Boss: Um... So our build is going to be broken the day before publication?

## Option 2: Pull an "all-nighter" on Saturday night
| Pros | Cons |
|-|-|
| You get the work done | The work might not be done well enough to get the code fixed |
| you can still respect your Sabbath while getting the code fixed | Means that Saturday night is going to be quite stressful getting the project fixed |

#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Ecclesiastes 9:10: - Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going

__*Principle*__ - Since you found the code on Saturday night, I would assume that you would still have some time to get the code fixed before Sunday hits. To respect my Sabbath, I would do my best to get the work done the day before, even if I had to stay up a "little" into Sunday morning. I would just rest all the more on Sunday knowing that I did good work the night before. 

#### Script
- You: Hey boss, I know that this project needs to get done by Tuesday, and that we need to have our branches done by Monday morning, but I can't do any of my work on Sunday for religious reasons.
- Boss: Ok, what’s the problem with having it done tonight? You are usually pretty good about getting your repos ready on Saturdays anyways...
- You: Well, my last additions broke the build...
- Boss: So you're going to fix it right?
- You: Yeah, I am going to stay up all night and get the solution for the bug. I'll let you know how it looks when I am done!
- Boss: Well, good luck, I am going to be in bed long before then!

## Option 3: Do the work on Sunday and forego your Sabbath
| Pros | Cons |
|-|-|
| You get the work done and avoid the conflict at work | You disrupt your Sabbath and do not rest on the Lord's day |

#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Matthew 12:11-12 - He said to them, “If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”

__*Principle*__ - The pros and cons are super similar to the 2nd option, so I am just going to have those ones there. But this option is you putting your work life before your spiritual life, and that makes me wonder if that creates work to be an idol above God in this case... But even Jesus said there is reasoning to do "good" on the Sabbath. 

#### Script
- You: Hey boss, I know that this project needs to get done by Tuesday, and that we need to have our branches done by Monday morning, but I can't do any of my work on Sunday for religious reasons.
- Boss: Ok, what’s the problem with having it done tonight? You are usually pretty good about getting your repos ready on Saturdays anyways...
- You: Well, my last additions broke the build...
- Boss: So you're going to fix it right?
- You: Yeah, I can just skip my Sabbath this week. I'll have it done by the end of Sunday, do not worry boss!

## Conclusion
No matter what way you spin this, you are going to lose. Either you have conflict at work, or conflict in your own spiritual life because you put work above meaningful rest with God. The best solution would be to find a way to minimize the damage and take the conflict out of those areas...

## My Final Choice
That is why I would go with option 2 and pull the "all nighter." If the work can be done well enough to solve the problem before you begin to take meaningful rest on Sunday, I think that helps solve the problem quite well.
