# Week _ Ethics Response
## Question: 
While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Answers
### Option 1: Approach the teammate about the situation
#### Pros
- Allows the teammate to rectify the situation and give their side of the story
- Shows that you still care about them as a person and that you are willing to help them out of a spot that they landed themselves in. 
- Creates the least amount of tension between the teammate and yourself while retconning the situation.
- Easiest way to come to a compromise. 
#### Cons
- Could lead to nothing happening if the teammate ignores you and takes the promotion. 
- Just your word and good faith might not be able to convince the teammate that they do not deserve the promotion, even though the situation is blatantly obvious.

#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Matthew 18:15-16 - “If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over. But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.”

__*Principle*__ - Having a level head and trying to keep the situation civil is a good first step to take. Keeping it between you means that no one else has to get involved and hopefully a resolution can be found quickly. 

#### Script
- You: Hey, Larry, heard that you got in the running for that upcoming promotion!
- Larry: Yeah, it’s pretty chill, I don’t even know why I got it!
- You: Larry, you got that opportunity because all of the work that we have been submitting upper management thinks that you have done solo. Do you think owning up to that and telling them the truth is a smart idea?
- Larry: Oh man, really? I had no idea…

### Option 2: Approach your boss/higher ups about the situation
#### Pros
- Shows that you care about the company and that you do not want someone irresponsible in a leadership role.
- Shows that you care about your position within the company and that you do not want your work to be miscredited 
- Would most likely lead to you getting the promotion rather than your teammate. 
#### Cons
- Could be seen as trying to wriggle your way to a promotion that you “did not” earn. 
- Other coworkers could see it as a “low-blow”
- Your bosses could not believe your side of the story and go ahead with the promotion. 

#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    1st Peter 2:14-15 – “Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.”

__*Principle*__ - With proper evidence, appealing to the managers and executives above you is the surefire way to make sure that the promotion is properly handed out. You just have to do it in a manner that is non-confrontational and creates as little conflict as possible. 

#### Script
- You: Hey boss, heard that Larry is in the running for that new promotion?
- Boss: Oh, that one younger dev? Yeah, he is one of the brightest we have, he must have had a really good teacher!
- You: Yeah… That’s been me. I’ve been training him, and he hasn’t been picking it up at all. The work that has been submitted is my work with him, not just his.
- Boss: So your saying…
- You: Yeah, all of that work has basically been mine, thought that would be important to know before promoting him

### Option 3: Convince the upper management to fire the teammate
#### Pros
- Takes away the pressure of the promotion going to someone that does not deserve it. 
- Could be seen as you watching out for the firm and its best interests.
#### Cons
- A lot higher risk of backfiring on you, as you would have to have a LOT of evidence. 
- Could fragment the team that you are a part of and cause more conflict in the workplace. 

#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Proverbs 13:4 – “A sluggard’s appetite is never filled, but the desires of the diligent are fully satisfied.

__*Principle*__ - This is the extreme side of the scenario. This one would only apply if the teammate was not a good member of the project team and was causing problems outside of getting an ill-earned promotion. It would be hard to pull off, but it could help the team overall. 

#### Script
- - You: Hey boss, heard that Larry is in the running for that new promotion?
- Boss: Oh, that one younger dev? Yeah, he is one of the brightest we have, he must have had a really good teacher!
- You: Yeah… That’s been me. I’ve been training him, and he hasn’t been picking it up at all. The work that has been submitted is my work with him, not just his.
- Boss: So your saying…
- You: Yeah, all of that work has basically been mine, thought that would be important to know before promoting him. Honestly I think that you should fire him because he hasn’t come forward about this situation and he has been dishonest about the work that he has been doing!
- Boss: Well, you raise a valid point with that. We’ll take it into consideration. 

## Conclusion
Overall this is a tough choice. Since you have been mentoring this team member and doing your best to help them grow, seeing them get the recognition for the work that you have been putting in would feel defeating. But the fact of the matter is that you have more say than the newer team member, so with that in mind… 

## My Final Choice
…I would choose option #2: going to the upper management. This is the option where you are guaranteed to see results, even if they might be extreme. It’s lets those in authority above you know that you are trying your best to look after the company while also putting effort into your own projects.
