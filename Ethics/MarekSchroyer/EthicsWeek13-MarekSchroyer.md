# Week _ Ethics Response
## Question:
While volunteering to help with computers at your church, you are given access to giving records. Because of your work, you unexpectedly discover your senior pastor does not give anything to your church. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

### Answers
## Option 1: Approach the Pastor directly about the situation
| Pros | Cons |
|-|-|
| This is a biblical teaching to go to a "brother" first | The pastor could lie and say that he has been, creating a rift in the church leadership |
| Keeps the situation private and gives your pastor a chance to explain himself | Could not accomplish anything/he could be stuck in his ways |

#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Matthew 18:15 - If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over.

__*Principle*__ - This would be the ideal situation, as it keeps the situation between the least amount of people as possible and prevents gossip being spread. You still need to come forward with why the pastor should be giving back to his own community, so make sure that you are prepared to discuss that as well. 

#### Script
- You: Hey pastor, great sermon! I loved how you incorporated that passage from Matthew...
- Pastor: I am glad that it resonated well with you!
- You: I think that one passage that really lands well with me is Matthew 18
- Pastor: Matthew 18 huh? About approaching a brother when they are in sin?
- You: Yeah, and I think I am using it's approach right now... Does the rest of the church know that you don't give any of your income back to the church family?
- Pastor: Um...

## Option 2: Approach the Elders about the situation
| Pros | Cons |
|-|-|
| They have the most sway with the pastor | They could ask why you were digging through the giving records |
| The next most biblical option when confronting someone in the church about issues | Causing divides in the church leadership could weaken the church |
| They have the power to make changes within the structure of the church to assure something is done about this situation | - |

#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Matthew 18:16 - But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that â€˜every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.

__*Principle*__ - The verse doesn't call for it to be the elders of the church, but it would be a smart idea to have the company of equals to hear the case that you make when asking the pastor about his giving habits. 

#### Script
- You: Hey pastor, great sermon! I loved how you incorporated that passage from Matthew...
- Pastor: Is this about the conversation that we had last week?
- You: Yes, and this time I have a few of the elders here to observe our conversation and have some fresh input on the matter.
- Pastor: Is that necessary?

## Option 3: Bring up the pastor's giving during a budget meeting with the church body
| Pros | Cons |
|-|-|
| Will cause some response within the church body and there will almost guaranteed be a result | Not going to be keeping the matter private, but if you hit this step already, then that goes out the window |
| This is the final step in the biblical path to solving issues within the church | The resulting punishment might be pretty severe to the pastor, as this is not taken lightly in some churches |

#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Matthew 18:17 - If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector.

__*Principle*__ - This is the final "step" in the journey of confronting a fellow believer in the church about their sin. It has the most engagement and can often cause the most strife and disagreement, since you are involving the whole church, but this means that the problem will truly be addressed. 

#### Script
- Pastor: Thanks everyone for making it to the budget meeting today! Our numbers are looking good and giving has gone up! So we are moving around some areas of the budget to be better utilized.
- You: That's awesome, but where specifically is the giving that you are putting into the fund for the church going? You must have a specific mission you are backing, correct?
- Pastor: Well, actually my giving is not shown here...
- Random Church Member: So where is it going then?
- You: Oh, he doesn't give so it won't be shown on here
- *Insert loud audible gasp*

## Conclusion
Since this is laid out as a timeline, any of these are viable answers for the decision. They can all accomplish the same end, but with varying levels of privacy, strife, or debate. 
## My Final Choice
So my final choice would be to start from the top, and work my way down. There is a reason that God gave us a logical way to mediate faults within the church, and it was because of situations like this.
