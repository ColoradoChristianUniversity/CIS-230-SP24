# Week 4 Ethics Response
## Question:
While working on a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three responses? What do you do?
## Answers
### Option 1: See if you can help your peer with the work
#### Pros
- Could relieve stress off of their plate.
- Still means the work gets done and your company keeps the client.
#### Cons
- Could put too much stress in your own workload and cause your own burnout.
- Your company could be displeased by your peers performance if he is not doing the work they are supposed to be doing. 
#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Leviticus 25:35 - If your brother becomes poor and cannot maintain himself with you, you shall support him as though he were a stranger and a sojourner, and he shall live with you.
__*Principle*__ - Knowing that a coworker is in a rough spot and not helping would be denying the duty that we have to show love and kindness to others. It would even have to be taking all the work, just helping out in small ways to take stress off their shoulders. 
#### Script
- You: Hey, how is the project going?
- Coworker: Yeah, not very good. It's causing a lot of problems that are weighing on me pretty hard both at work and at home. 
- You: Man, that sucks, is there anything that I can do for you? Can I help with the project maybe?
- Coworker: Yeah, I could use some help with this one section right here, thanks for offering! 

### Option 2: Talk it out with them/encouragement to pursue therapy
#### Pros
- Asking them to seek outside help means that you can still focus on your job while they are trying to find a solution. 
- Could be a solution to a problem that has been brewing for a while
#### Cons
- They could take that the wrong way/be offended by that ask.
- It could potentially not fix the problem. 
#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Proverbs 1:5: Let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance
__*Principle*__ - Encouraging your coworker to seek outside help is never a bad suggestion. It just goes to show that you more than likely are not qualified to handle the situation they are in, and that there are people that could step in and help.
#### Script
- You: Hey, how is the project going?
- Coworker: Yeah, not very good. It's causing a lot of problems that are weighing on me pretty hard both at work and at home. 
- You: Man, that sucks, is there anything that I can do for you?
- Coworker: I don't really know, it's all a little crazy...
- You: Well, if I can't maybe this person can, they are a good therapist that I have known for a while. 
- Coworker: Wow thanks, I'll look into it! 

### Option 3: Go to upper management for a solution
#### Pros
- Keeping it internal means that work will still be relatively productive. 
- Means that you can help keep tabs on them as they work
#### Cons
- Management could be dulled down to things like this and not react accordingly to the coworker's depression. 
- Your coworker could not like you reaching out to management on their behalf
#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Hebrews 13:17 - Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority, because they keep watch over you as those who must give an account. Do this so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no benefit to you.
__*Principle*__ - Your managers would like to know about the things going on within the project and this is a way to let them see the details. Not oversharing on your coworkers behalf is a critical step though. 
#### Script
- - You: Hey, how is the project going?
- Coworker: Yeah, not very good. It's causing a lot of problems that are weighing on me pretty hard both at work and at home. 
- You: Man, that sucks, is there anything that I can do for you? Do you think we should go to management about this?
- Coworker: Management? What can they do?
- You: Well, they could help with finding external resources and they could take some of your workload off. 
- Coworker: That's maybe not a bad idea...
## Conclusion
This is a tough decision to be in. Having someone that is working on a project with you admit that they are not in a good mental state can throw a wrench in your work schedule. Making the best decision for them or the company is a strange place to be in as someone who is just working on the project. I would still want to do what I could for my coworker while keeping the interests of the company in mind, so inquiring more about their situation is a must. 
## My Final Choice
With that in mind, I would choose the 2nd option of asking them to pursue therapy/external counsel. As qualified as I would be to help them deal with their problems, I think that a therapist would be better to keep this out of the workplace and let us focus on our tasks while still helping them work on their depression.
