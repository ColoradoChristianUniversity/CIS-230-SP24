# Week 5 Ethics Response
## Question:
You are a Computer Science professor at a local university teaching C Sharp to some very smart business students. In the second week of class, you spend an entire lecture with your students exhaustively talking about software plagiarism and copyright law with a Christian intellectual property attorney who makes it truly clear that taking code from another developer or site then calling it your own is not only legally wrong but morally wrong. Just a week or two into class, one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. Too good? You check and discover the code is identical to a C# tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. The writing is on the wall. But remember, you love this student: you don't want to overreact. But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: you don't want to underreact. A lot to think about. What do you do?
## Answers
### Option 1: Fail the student
#### Pros
- You follow the academic policy of the school to a T. 
- Your superiors cannot be upset with you for following policy
#### Cons
- It could be seen as harsh from the other students and faculty.
- You could not have the full story and miss the opportunity to ask the student questions about their decisions.
#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Proverbs 13:13 - He who scorns instruction will pay for it, but he who respects a command is rewarded.
__*Principle*__ - Since we are looking at a large range of choices, having one where the student is flunked outright is something that could happen. Most institutions have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to taking other people's work without crediting them, and that student should have been aware of that. 
#### Script
- You: Hey Billy, this assignment that you turned in is really good! Where did you get the code from?
- Billy: Yeah, I took a long time making that one!
- You: No, Billy... I know you took the code from somewhere online. Where did you take it from?
- Billy: *silence*
- You: Well, looks like I am going to have to talk to the dean about this... I have half a mind to fail you out of the course

### Option 2: Just fail them on this particular assignment
#### Pros
- The student has a chance to redeem themselves in the course. 
- You know to keep an eye on them moving forward, and you still can let the dean know about the cheating. 
#### Cons
- It could be seen as a little too soft, not silencing plagiarism where the deed was done.
- The original owner of the code could be upset that you are not punishing the student more severely. 
#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Colossians 3:13-14 - Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity

__*Principle*__ - Even though the policy says that they *can* be failed, that does not mean that you have to flunk them right away. Giving them a second chance shows that you are willing to let them redeem themselves and that they should take the chance they are given. This would hopefully give them a nudge in the right direction, as well as send a message to their peers and your fellow teachers that you mean business when it comes to school policy. 
#### Script
- You: Hey Billy, this assignment that you turned in is really good! Where did you get the code from?
- Billy: Yeah, I took a long time making that one!
- You: No, Billy... I know you took the code from somewhere online. Where did you take it from?
- Billy: *silence*
- You: Well, looks like I am going to have to talk to the dean about this... I am going to fail you on this assignment as well, but I want to see some top notch work from you moving forward, or at least some citations in your workbooks! 

### Option 3: Let the dean decide their fate
#### Pros
- Means the decision is out of your hands (your hands are washed)
- The student will still get a just punishment for what they did
#### Cons
- Your students could see you as a "sellout" where you only listen to the policy of the school and don't care about the wellbeing of your students. 
#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Proverbs 18:15 - The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge, for the ears of the wise seek it out.
__*Principle*__ - 
#### Script
- You: Hey Billy, this assignment that you turned in is really good! Where did you get the code from?
- Billy: Yeah, I took a long time making that one!
- You: No, Billy... I know you took the code from somewhere online. Where did you take it from?
- Billy: *silence*
- You: Well, looks like I am going to have to talk to the dean about this... I don't know what he is going to do to you, but I wish you the best of luck
## Conclusion
This is a tough spot to be in as an instructor. You obviously want what is best for your students, but at the same time they cannot just get off Scott-free and break the rules when they want. Discipline is needed in situations like this, but from what source is the question... And it goes without saying that I would want grace in this situation as a student, even if I didn't deserve it. 
## My Final Choice
That makes my final choice the second option: fail them on just this assignment. They still get a punishment, and you still inform your superiors, but they get a chance to redeem themselves moving forward and hopefully learn a valuable lesson.
