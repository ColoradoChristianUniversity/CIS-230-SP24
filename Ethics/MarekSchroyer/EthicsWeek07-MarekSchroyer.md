# Week _ Ethics Response
## Question:
A junior engineer at your company, leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence, has completed a critical software project well ahead of schedule. The AI has written almost the entire application, raising questions about the engineer's understanding of the project's intricacies. Despite this, the company's management, impressed by the speedy delivery, is planning to integrate this AI-generated software into major systems immediately. You are concerned but you are also friends with this junior developer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Answers
### Option 1: Discuss the Code with your project head
#### Pros
- Get's your superiors involved before the project is published. 
- Means the code is going to be verified and the engineers work will be examined.
- Shows that you care about the company and it's clients
#### Cons
- Undermines the junior engineers place in the project. 
- Doesn't give a chance for the engineer to explain the project
#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Ephesians 6:5-9 - Those who are employed should listen to their employers and obey their instructions with great respect and honor. Serve them with humility in your hearts as though you were working for the Master.
__*Principle*__ -  Since you want to show your company that you care, I think that mentioning the possibility of the code that the junior dev creates being a problem is within your responsibilities. 
#### Script
- You: So Larry already got his side of the project done?
- Project Head: Yeah, Larry has been hammering out his projects as of late!
- You: Yeah, I guess with the use of AI he's been able to get ahead of the curve. 
- Project Head: Wait, he's been using AI on his projects?
- You: Yeah, I thought you should know. I'd double check the code and maybe have a sit down with Larry. 

### Option 2: Review the code with the junior developer
#### Pros
- Direct involvment with them, meaning that you can get the whole story and all the facts. 
- Doesn't step on anyones toes (yet)
- Still shows that you want the company to succeed
#### Cons
- You might not have the authority to do anything about the dev's code. 
- It might seem condescending to the junior dev and they might not take it well
#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Galatians 6:1-2 - Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently.
__*Principle*__ - At least offering some input into the situation should be helpful, and at least attempting to review the code before it's published is better than nothing. 
#### Script
- You: Hey Larry, how is that project going?
- Larry: Oh, I already have it done! AI really helped me speed up the process, and I don't even have to worry about review, the high-ups already ok'ed the project!
- You: Oh, don't you think you should at least review the code for errors? I can help you with that!
- Larry: Sure, if you are offering to help, I don't see why not. 

### Option 3: Offer no input at all
#### Pros
- Means that you stay out of the situation and that it's not in your hands
#### Cons
- Could harm the company in the long run. 
- Junior Dev could loose their job. 
- You have to live with the fact that you knew about this. 
#### Scripture, Principals, and Script
    Psalm 37:7 - Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him; do not fret when people succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes.
__*Principle*__ - Sometimes you just have to let the problems in the world work themselves out, even if your input could do something. It might not be your place to speak up at a time like this, or both of the parties could deny the previous attempts. 
#### Script
- Larry: Hey, I just submitted the final edits for my repo! How is yours coming along?
- You: I am getting there, got about a week left.
- Project Head: Man, why can't you get your work done fast like Larry?

## Conclusion
Overall, this situation has a pretty clear cut response. I think that with the current information given, at least reaching out to the junior dev is agreeable. And if they retaliate or don't want to change anything about their code, then that is their decision. 
## My Final Choice
So clearly my final choice is clearly reaching out to the junior dev and asking if they want to sit down and review their code.
