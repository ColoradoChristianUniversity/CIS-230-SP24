# Week 6 Ethics Response
## Question:
The root of this site has the ethics write-up of everyone in class. You can go there, and you can browse and read anyone's essays. Looking back on the first 5 week's prompts, choose the one that resonated with you most. Pick two other students in class and read their options and their choices. In this week's essay, summarize each of those responses with a simple bullet list in your own file and then pretend THEIR CHOICES are the only choices you have (don't go back and revisit your essay for the prompt). Given their choices only, which would YOU choose? Do you agree with the authors? Explain why or why not.

    Prompt Chosen: Week 2 - Machine Learning - Choosing Evan's and Jaxson's Prompts
## Answers
### Option 1: Anonymous Whistleblowing - Evan
- This option shows the moral ground that you are willing to "die" on to help the employees of your client. 
- This can also be recorded legally if the client has employess that sued because they lost their job. 
- Due to the anoyomous nature of this stance it will help your conscious in the long run
- Could make your own company question your loyalty and willingness to do a job. 
### Option 2: In between for and against
- Brought up the idea of laying off some, but not all
- Means that the workers could be going to a company that values them more and can use their work more 
- Brought up the idea of helping the laid off workers find new jobs, which is all things considered a good compromise
- This option has the greatest chance of me (the worker) losing my job. 
## Conclusion
Both these choices are pretty similar, as they are both trying to find a compromise to the initial solution of getting all 175 employees laid off. One of them asks the boss to find a solution, while the other makes a stand on the idea of the company at least helping their workers before they lay them off. I think that because Jaxson highlighted that in his response, I would choose his over Evans. Even though he highlights the risk, I think that ethically this would be the right decision to make.
