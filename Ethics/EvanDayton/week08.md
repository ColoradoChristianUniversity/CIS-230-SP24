Week 8 Ethics Assignment - Evan Dayton
Ethical Situation Week 8

***Prompt:***

While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he's up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

**Response 1: Direct Communication with Leadership**

# Pros:

    Clarity and Transparency: Directly informing leadership ensures they are aware of the situation and can take appropriate action.
    Protecting Your Reputation: Clarifying your role in the work prevents potential damage to your reputation and future opportunities.
    Fairness: Ensuring that credit is attributed accurately promotes fairness and integrity within the team and the organization.

# Cons:

    Potential Conflict: Directly confronting leadership may lead to conflict or tension within the team or organization.
    Impact on Relationship: The teammate may feel betrayed or resentful if they learn you intervened in their raise decision.
    Misinterpretation: There is a risk that leadership may misinterpret your intentions, leading to misunderstandings.

Script/Dialog:
"I wanted to clarify my role in the project that my teammate is being credited for. While I value our teamwork, I believe it's important for my contributions to be recognized accurately in the context of this raise decision."

* Biblical Reference:
"The integrity of the upright guides them, but the crookedness of the treacherous destroys them." - Proverbs 11:3

*First Principle:*
Upholding integrity and ensuring fairness should guide actions in addressing the misattribution of credit.

*Personal Choice & Explanation:*
I would choose this response as it prioritizes clarity and integrity. It is important to ensure that credit is attributed accurately to maintain fairness and uphold professional standards.

**Response 2: Indirect Communication through HR**

# Pros:

    Neutral Mediation: Involving HR can provide a neutral and objective perspective on the situation.
    Confidentiality: HR can handle the issue discreetly, protecting your relationship with your teammate and leadership.
    Policy Adherence: HR can ensure that company policies regarding performance evaluation and recognition are followed.

# Cons:

    Potential Delay: Involving HR may lead to delays in addressing the issue, especially if HR needs to investigate further.
    Limited Control: HR's decision-making process and outcomes may not align with your expectations or desired outcomes.
    Impact on Relationship: Your teammate may feel betrayed if they perceive HR's involvement as an attack on their credibility.

Script/Dialog:
"I'd like to discuss a situation regarding the attribution of credit for a project. I believe there may be a misunderstanding that needs clarification to ensure fairness in the recognition process."

* Biblical Reference:
"Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others." - Philippians 2:4

*First Principle:*
Seeking resolution through appropriate channels and upholding fairness should guide actions in addressing the misattribution of credit.

*Personal Choice & Explanation:*
I would consider this response if I believe HR can handle the situation more effectively and impartially. Involving HR can ensure that company policies are followed and that the issue is addressed in a fair and objective manner.

**Response 3: Mentorship and Guidance**

# Pros:

    Educational Opportunity: Using this situation as a teaching moment can help your teammate understand the importance of accurate attribution and professional integrity.
    Building Trust: Approaching the situation with empathy and mentorship can strengthen your relationship with your teammate.
    Resolution without Conflict: Addressing the issue directly with your teammate can resolve the situation without involving leadership or HR.

# Cons:

    Limited Impact: Your teammate may not fully understand or accept your perspective, leading to continued misattribution of credit.
    Time and Effort: Mentoring and guiding your teammate through this situation may require additional time and effort.
    Potential Misunderstanding: Your teammate may misunderstand your intentions, leading to further tension or conflict.

Script/Dialog:
"I've noticed that there may be some confusion about our roles in the project. I value our collaboration and teamwork, and I think it's important for us to clarify our contributions to ensure fairness in how credit is attributed."

* Biblical Reference:
"And as you wish that others would do to you, do so to them." - Luke 6:31

*First Principle:*
Guiding and mentoring with empathy and understanding should guide actions in addressing the misattribution of credit.

*Personal Choice & Explanation:*
I would choose this response if I believe that mentorship and guidance can effectively resolve the situation. It allows for a constructive approach that prioritizes education and relationship-building.
