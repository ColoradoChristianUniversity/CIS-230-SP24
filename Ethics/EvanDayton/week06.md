Week 6 Ethics Assignment - Evan Dayton

Israel Munguia - Week 2:
Response 1: Request off of the project

    Pros: This option avoids direct involvement in the project that could lead to layoffs, showing consideration for the affected employees.
    Cons: There is no guarantee that the request will be granted, and it does not address the underlying issue of potential layoffs.

Response 2: Take on the project

    Pros: By accepting the project, one maintains their job and is seen as loyal and cooperative to the company, potentially benefiting financially.
    Cons: This decision directly impacts many lives and could lead to a loss of trust among peers and potential ethical concerns.

Response 3: Talk to boss about finding different solutions

    Pros: Initiating a discussion with the boss and customer about alternative solutions shows initiative and empathy, potentially leading to a more positive outcome for all parties.
    Cons: There is no guarantee that a solution will be found, and the process could be costly and time-consuming.

Gabe Wassmer - Week 2:
Response 1: Refuse to take the job unless the company finds ways to keep employees

    Pros: This response upholds personal ethics and demonstrates loyalty to fellow workers.
    Cons: It could result in a loss of trust from the company, strained relationships, and potentially losing one's job.

Response 2: Take the job and research a way for the company to be more efficient

    Pros: Shows care for all parties involved and demonstrates a proactive approach to finding a solution.
    Cons: It may seem unappreciative, require skills outside one's expertise, and be stressful.

Response 3: Do the job, no questions asked

    Pros: Demonstrates commitment to professional responsibilities and retains trust from the company.
    Cons: Could lead to personal discomfort, raise ethical concerns, and establish a pattern of layoffs.

Analysis and Final Choice:

Both sets of responses highlight the ethical dilemma of balancing professional responsibilities with concerns for the well-being of others. Munguia's responses emphasize the importance of empathy and consideration for those affected by the project, while Wassmer's responses focus on taking action and finding practical solutions.

I thionk the overall better choice is Gabe's' response 2: Taking the job and researching a way for the company to be more efficient while retaining employees. This decision demonstrates a proactive approach to problem-solving and a commitment to serving the interests of all stakeholders. It also acknowledges the complexity of the situation and the need to balance professional obligations with ethical considerations.
