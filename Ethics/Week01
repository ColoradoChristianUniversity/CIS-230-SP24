#Week 01 Ethics Jewels Marlewski
While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employerâ€™s second largest customer: a well-known pornography web site. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
* One response would be to go along with it and provide the resolutions for the company regardless of their profit. A second response would be to refuse to work with the company at the risk of your (probably decent paying) job. A third possible response would be to ask if the task can be diverted to another engineer, possibly still having to carry out the task.
* I believe I would respond with the third option. This is because I should have done more research on the company I am employed by if morality and ethics would be as big of an issue. While I would explore the options to not condone pornography, I am at fault. The company (presumably secular) hired me in order to carry out a task, if ethics were an issue, I should have done much more research on my employer beforehand.
