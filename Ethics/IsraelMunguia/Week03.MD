### Response 1: Implement the back door code

**Pros:**

- Allows the authorities to capture criminals

- Gives company a good relationship with authorities

**Cons:**

- May cause controversy and uproar from the userbase

- Back door code is primarily malicious, so is built on immoral standings

**Script:**

*Authorities:* “We want you to implement some back door code that they can use to track some behavior that may link some users to child trafficking convictions. Could you take on this task for us?”
*Me:* “Sure. I would do anything to help bust terrible people like this. Let me set up a meeting for us to go over the specifics for what you want us to do.”

**Scripture:**
>Genesis 9:6 (NIV): Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image.

**First Principle:**
God made man in His own image, and those who sin in such a way that they are objectifying children in an exploitative way should be punished for what they are doing. This punishment can, hopefully, be used for good and help get these people to turn to Christ.

### Response 2: Say no to the project
**Pros:**

- Will not require the need for malicious code
- Will not potentially compromise the privacy of the average user

**Cons:**

- Still lets such criminals use the software
- Loses potential relationship with authorities
- Could be seen as ‘the wrong move’ and controversial

**Script:**

*Authorities:* “We want you to implement some back door code that they can use to track some behavior that may link some users to child trafficking convictions. Could you take on this task for us?”

*Me:* “I understand the reason behind implementing this, but the use of malicious code does not sit right with me. Plus, I would not want to compromise the safety and privacy of anyone who is simply using the software casually. I don’t think I can do this project in the way you are asking me to.”

*Authorities:* “I understand. We still really encourage you to crack down on some means of stopping these criminals from using your product. Let us know how we can support you in finding ways to do this.”

**Scripture:**
>Romans 1:24 (ESV): “Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves.”

**Second Principle:**
Sometimes, we try to do God’s job for Him. We feel that we need to do our part in convicting those who are deep in sin. This can be good and bad. For one, God calls us to be the light of the world, but He also says to do so in love. Sometimes, this looks like stepping back, and other times, this looks like going all in.

### Response 3: Propose a different solution to the problem

**Pros:**

- Does not require the use of malicious code
- Can be more catered to the company standards and goals
- Does not have to sacrifice the privacy of the users
- Gets rid of any moral dilemmas

**Cons:**
- Authorities may not respond well to the request
- Could be a more expensive and time-consuming solution
- Solution may be more complicated

**Script:**

*Authorities:* “We want you to implement some back door code that they can use to track some behavior that may link some users to child trafficking convictions. Could you take on this task for us?”

*Me:* “I think this is definitely something we should look into, but I do not agree with using malicious code to get this done. I have some other ideas that we can use to resolve this issue, though. Can I propose them to you?”

*Authorities:* “Sure. I understand where you are coming from, so lets see if we can come up with something better.”

**Scripture:**
>James 1:5 (NIV): “If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you.”

**Third Principle:**
As shown above, God promises to provide wisdom when we ask Him. When we are stuck trying to find a solution to a problem or the solution to such a moral dilemma, He will give it to us. Granted, God can give us wisdom in many different ways that may not allow the solution to go as planned, but God’s way is always the right way.

### Conclusion:
Inherently, this situation is grounded in good intent. Of course, putting criminals to justice is seen as a good action. This raises the problem, however, where we try to take on God’s role in enforcing justice in the world. This does not mean that we should just sit around and do nothing, however, as that is not what we are called to do either. There is a balance in everything, and with God’s guidance, we can find that balance.

This situation is complicated, but as Christians, there is the moral side of our hearts that pushes us to convict these criminals. This means that we want to do something to prevent criminal acts from happening within our products. We also have the responsibility of doing so in a biblically moral way. With back door code, since it is grounded in immorality, some can claim that this solution is in misalignment with the bible. Either way, God promises us wisdom when we ask, so he will provide us with a good moral compass to go off of whenever such a moral dilemma is presented.

### Decision:
I choose to go with option 3. It is another middle-ground solution that, in my eyes, finds the good on both sides of the moral dilemma. For one, it can be done without the need for malicious code. For two, it still prevents evil from happening behind the scenes. It may be more complicated in the long run, but that is a risk I would be willing to take with this solution.
