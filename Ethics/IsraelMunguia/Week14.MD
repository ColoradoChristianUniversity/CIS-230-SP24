## Response 1: Finish developing the tool for its intended use

| **Pros**                                           | **Cons**                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| - Hard work pays off through a finished product    | - Product could be used for evil                    |
| - Satisfies customer                              | - Public spaces will be secularized                 |
| - Product itself could still be revolutionary     |                                                     |

**Script:**

*Boss:* “We are planning on using this tool to get rid of religious symbols in public spaces. We think this will help our public spaces become more neutral for everyone.”

*Me:* “Well, I don’t entirely agree with your use of this tool, but as long as you do not abuse it, you can do whatever you want with it. Tools are only bad if the people who use them are bad.”

*Boss:* “I understand your point of view. Thank you for working on this with us.”

**Scripture:**
>Jeremiah 29:11 [ESV]: “For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.”

**Principle 1:** Tools are neutral, and people can use them for good or evil. We cannot change that, and all we can do is trust in God because of His promise of doing good in our lives.

## Response 2: Propose the development of regulatory protocols for the tool

| **Pros**                                           | **Cons**                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| - Is a bit of a middle-ground                      | - Request may not be granted                        |
| - Will still allow for people’s freedom of religion| - May not entirely solve the root problem          |
| - Shows good initiative and care                   |                                                     |

**Script:**

*Boss:* “We are planning on using this tool to get rid of religious symbols in public spaces. We think this will help our public spaces become more neutral for everyone.”

*Me:* “Actually, I have been meaning to talk to you about this. I think there are a lot of problems with you using this tool this way. I think it limits people’s freedom of religion and, in a way, does the opposite of what you might be wanting to accomplish.”

*Boss:* “Interesting. Well, what do you think we should do?”

*Me:* “I think we should devote some funding to developing some regulatory measures to make sure your use of the tool doesn’t get out-of-hand, especially since it may be used by other government agencies as well.”

*Boss:* “Fair enough. We will consider it.”

**Scripture:**
>Ephesians 4:32 [ESV]: “Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.”

**Principle 2:** As Christian engineers, we have a moral responsibility to help produce our work in a way that will not harm anyone. We should do what we can to fulfill this responsibility.

## Response 3: Propose another intended use for the tool

| **Pros**                                           | **Cons**                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| - Will not get rid of your hard work              | - Request may be denied                             |
| - Will prevent possible immoral use of the tool   | - May require changes to the tool                   |
| - Will exemplify care for the moral use of the tool|                                                     |
| - Will still allow for freedom of religion        |                                                     |

**Script:**

*Boss:* “We are planning on using this tool to get rid of religious symbols in public spaces. We think this will help our public spaces become more neutral for everyone.”

*Me:* “Actually, I have been meaning to talk to you about this. I think there are a lot of problems with you using this tool this way. I think it limits people’s freedom of religion and, in a way, does the opposite of what you might be wanting to accomplish.”

*Boss:* “Interesting. Well, what do you think we should do?”

*Me:* “I think we could actually use the tool for a lot of other things that do not take away from people’s right to practice their religion. I have brainstormed through some options that I think will be much better than what you are thinking. Could we set up a meeting to discuss this further?”

*Boss:* “Absolutely. Thank you for letting me know.”

**Scripture:**
>Isaiah 54:17 [ESV]: “No weapon that is fashioned against you shall succeed, and you shall refute every tongue that rises against you in judgment. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their vindication from me, declares the Lord.”

**Principle 3:** Hard work does not have to go to waste, especially if you devote it to the Lord. There can always be a silver lining.

## Conclusion:
Tools themselves are not inherently evil. They are neutral, but they can easily be used for evil. In this case, our project could easily be abused for the wrong reasons. This means that we have a responsibility to do what we can to prevent such evil from happening. We are supposed to be the light in the darkness, so, as engineers, we need to enforce some way of preventing bad from happening with our product. Not only this, but this whole scenario seems to even impose on the constitutional rights of Americans, which makes it odd that the government was thinking of using the product in this way. Overall, there should be some effort made to making sure no such evil can be done with the tool.

## My Choice:
I would choose choice 3. It shows that I care about the people and the moral aspect of my job. It also shows that I am a good worker who exceeds the expectation that may have been set by my boss. Even better, it will prevent the tool from taking away the freedom of the public. If done correctly, it can be used in a much better way with this choice.
