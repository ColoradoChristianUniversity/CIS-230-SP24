### Jewels Marlewski Summary
**First response is to offer support and encouragement**
- Supports good environment and teammate will not feel alone in his struggles
- Could not fully fix problem and cause distractions and professional issues
- Bible says to bear one another’s burdens and offer help

**Second response is to encourage professional help**
- Encourages and provides help as well as alleviates need for worker intervention, and it fixes the root cause
- Could make teammate feel alone, and it uses further resources
- Bible says that God is the ultimate source of help

**Third response is to adjust workload and provide flexibility**
- Fosters good work environment and morale, and it relieves stress from the worker
- Doesn’t address root issues, and may cause stress for other workers
- Bible says that we need to look at the interest of others and help them

**Choice:** Both offer support and relieve workload since it shows compassion for teammate’s well-being and helps address the root cause of the issue.

### My choice: 
Given the two choices, I would choose Jewels’ choice since it provides the most help for the worker. While I think that the worker should find some more professional help for such a serious situation, it is good that the teammate has the opportunity to talk it through with people in the same environment as him. It also give the worker some time to actually take action on the issues, and many means of relieving stress will have a good impact. Gabe’s choice will still help, but it seems like it will only temporarily relieve the problem.
