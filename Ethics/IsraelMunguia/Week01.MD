### Response 1: Do the job anyway and help the porn company. 

**Pros:**

- Get to keep the job

- Seen as more reliable and loyal

**Cons:**

- Directly supporting a company that entirely runs against biblical principles

- May leave the door open to future possible immoral opportunities

**Script:**

*Boss:* “Hey, we need you to help Porn Company with these issues. Could you take on this project for us? It would really help both parties out.”

*Me:* “Sure, why not.”

*Boss:* “Great. Let’s get started then.”

**Scripture:**

>Matthew 9:13 [NIV]: “But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”

**First Principle:**
Doing God’s work requires you to go into the world of the sinner, and doing so in this situation might look like taking on the project.

### Response 2: Cut ties with your own company.
**Pros:**
- Don’t directly support the porn company
- Don’t support your own company as they support the porn company
- Have almost no moral dilemma as a result

**Cons:**
- Lost your job
- May have left team when they needed you

**Script:**

*Boss:* “Hey, we need you to help Porn Company with these issues. Could you take on this project for us? It would really help both parties out.”

*Me:* “Hmmm. Honestly, I don’t think I can. I do not believe that pornography should be something that we should support. In fact, since this client is so crucial for this company, I don’t think it would be wise for me to move forward with this position.”

*Boss:* “I understand. I hope your job search goes well.”

**Scripture:**
>Matthew 5:28 (ESV): “But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.”

**Second Principle:**
Taking on such a project will not only put you in a world of temptation, but it will also support millions of other people in their sin.

### Response 3: Find the middle ground by requesting to be put on a different project and explaining the reasoning behind the request.
**Pros:**
- Get to keep job (hopefully)
- Will not have to deal with a moral dilemma
- Remain loyal and respectful in company’s eyes

**Cons:**
- Possible that boss will not respond well to the request
- Will have more difficulty being able to evangelize to the people within the porn company

**Script:**

*Boss:* “Hey, we need you to help Porn Company with these issues. Could you take on this project for us? It would really help both parties out.”

*Me:* “I understand the importance this client holds for this company, but the moral basis behind their products is something I do not agree with. Would it be possible for me to take on a different project instead?”

*Boss:* “I understand. Let me see if there is any need for help around the company and I will get back to you.”

**Scripture:**
>1 Corinthians 6:18 [ESV]: Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.

**Third Principle:**
It is always important to respectfully find the balance between moral dilemmas with such grey areas and what the Bible says.

### Conclusion:
It is no question that the Bible is against sexually immoral acts and practices, such as pornography. However, the Bible does not give a situation specifically that can be applied to this. What we know is that as Christians, we need to flee temptation, but we also have the duty to spread the Gospel to those who are lost. Not only this, but we have the obligation to work and support our families. Putting all of this into consideration, there must be a balance between these factors.

In short, this moral dilemma deals blurs the line between fleeing from sin and doing our Christian duties.

### My Choice:
I would choose response 3. I usually try to find the middle ground in these situations, and this choice seems to check all of the boxes I described in the conclusion. With this choice, I am running from temptation whether my boss chooses to fire me or not. If he does not fire me, I still have the opportunity to evangelize and explain my decision to those who may not understand. I also will still be able to support myself and my family.
