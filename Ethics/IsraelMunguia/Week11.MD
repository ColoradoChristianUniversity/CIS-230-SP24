## Response 1: Research for another 3rd party software that can do it quicker

| **Pros**                                     | **Cons**                                        |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| - Has the possibility of significantly lessening the workload | - May not yield any helpful results |
| - Makes the problem solvable                 | - Could waste a lot of valuable time |
| - Does not require the need to talk to the higher-ups | |

**Script:**

*Boss:* “Are you able to solve this problem in 2 months?”

*Me:* “I can, but it is too complicated to do on my own. I will look into some 3rd party software that will help me finish it in time. The one we have will take too long, so I will let you know what I find.”

*Boss:* “Great. We will help provide you with whatever you need.”

**Scripture:**
>Matthew 7:7 [ESV]: “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.”

**Principle 1:** There is always a better solution to a problem out there. As long as we put in some good work to find it, it will be in our hands.


## Response 2: Come up with a list of resources you need in order to solve the problem in time, show them to the higher-ups

| **Pros**                                     | **Cons**                                        |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| - Shows initiative                           | - Is time-consuming                              |
| - Shows humility                             | - Initial estimate of needed resources may not be correct |
| - Will provide whatever is needed to finish the job | - Request may not be granted |

**Script:**

*Boss:* “Are you able to solve this problem in 2 months?”

*Me:* “I can, but it is too complicated to do on my own. I have a list of some things I need in order to do it, hopefully, by the 2 month mark. If you want it done, you will have to provide me with these.”

*Boss:* “We can absolutely provide these for you. Thank you for the list, and we will let you know when these resources are ready to go.”

**Scripture:**
>Nehemiah 2:7-8 [ESV]: “And I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors of the province Beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah, 8 and a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress of the temple, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall occupy.” And the king granted me what I asked, for the good hand of my God was upon me.”

**Principle 3:** Always be prepared when making a request or when answering to someone, especially authority.


## Response 3: Go to the higher-ups, explain the situation, and request help

| **Pros**                                     | **Cons**                                        |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| - Shows humility                             | - Does not provide them with a comprehensive list of what is needed |
| - Shows initiative                           | - Still may be denied help                       |
| - Expresses the importance of the situation to the higher-ups | - May require a lot of company money             |

**Script:**

*Boss:* “Are you able to solve this problem in 2 months?”

*Me:* “I can, but it is too complicated to do on my own. I will go to the higher-ups, explain the situation, and request their help.”

*Boss:* “We appreciate your initiative. Please keep us updated.”

**Scripture:**
>Nehemiah 2:4 [ESV]: “Then the king said to me, ‘What are you requesting?’ So I prayed to the God of heaven.”

**Principle 2:** Nehemiah needed resources, so he asked the king. If we do not take initiative in asking authority for help, then they can’t help us.

## Conclusion:

There will always be a solution to a problem, no matter how impossible the problem may seem. Whenever we are faced with a situation like this, we can refer to Nehemiah’s story in the Bible. He faced a lot of hardships, but he showed what good management and work-ethic can do. This does not mean that every issue will end positively. The reality is that since we live in a broken world, nothing will ever end perfectly. In order to try our best to make things end perfectly, we need to take initiative, prepare, and take action.

## My Choice:

I would choose a combination of response 2 and 3. I would try to get a good comprehensive list of resources I may need along with some questions to ask. I would also be sure to learn deeply about the problem and any related topics. This way, I can make a good request for my boss while also explaining the situation and asking for help. This will have several benefits, and even though it may not end entirely the way I want, it will still leave some good lasting impressions.
