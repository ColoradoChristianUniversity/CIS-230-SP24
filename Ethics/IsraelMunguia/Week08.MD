## Response 1: Say ‘It Is What It Is’ and move on

**Pros:** 
-	Does not require any higher-up involvement
-	Will not raise any immediate drama
-	Worker is able to benefit from it

**Cons:**
-	I do not get the raise I think I may deserve
-	The worker will continue to remain unqualified
-	Resentment and jealousy may result
-	Team morale may go down

**Script:**

*Management:* “John is eligible for a raise. We’ve noticed that he has done some great work in your team. He seems to really be catching on quick.”

*Me:* “Yeah, I guess so. I have been mentoring him a lot, but if you guys think that he is deserving of this raise, all power to you. Let me know if he still needs a hand.”

**Scripture:**

> Romans 8:28 [ESV]: “And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.”

**Principle 1:** Sometimes, the sin of the world simply throws things at us that we cannot control or that we should not try to control. It sucks, but in those times, we need to take a deep breath and know that we have a God who has a better purpose and plan.

## Response 2: Explain the situation to management

**Pros:**
-	Gives management the truth
-	Allows the potential for just actions to be made
-	Humbly leaves the decision still up to management

**Cons:**
-	Worker still may reap the benefits of other people’s work depending on management’s decision
-	Does not guarantee all issues will be resolved

**Script:**

*Management:* “John is eligible for a raise. We’ve noticed that he has done some great work in your team. He seems to really be catching on quick.”

*Me:* “Well, in reality, he really is not. I have been trying to mentor him for the past 6 months, and he has not been doing well. A lot of the work that you all may think is done by him is actually from both of us, mainly me.”

*Management:* “Interesting. Well, if this is true, we may have to reevaluate our decision. Thank you for giving us your side of the story.”

**Scripture:**

> Ephesians 4:15 [ESV]: “Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ,”

**Principle 2:** We are supposed to tell the truth in love and humility. In this situation, it may be out of our responsibility to try and take matters into our own hands, so all we can do is say what needs to be said.

## Response 3: Gently push for my own raise

**Pros:**
-	Explains the truth to management
-	Will probably not provide the other worker with unjustified benefits
-	May give me a deserved raise

**Cons:**
-	May make me seem bitter
-	Other worker will not receive any benefits
-	It is still up to management’s decision

**Script:**

*Management:* “John is eligible for a raise. We’ve noticed that he has done some great work in your team. He seems to really be catching on quick.”

*Me:* “Well, in reality, he really is not. I have been doing a lot of the work alongside him as I try to mentor him. It has been 6 months, and I am really the one carrying him along. If I may say, I believe that I am deserving of a raise.”

*Management:* “Why is that?”

*Me:* “I have been doing a lot of the work alongside him as I try to mentor him. It has been 6 months, and I am really the one carrying him along. He has not caught on to what I have been trying to teach him, and I have seen it in his work. I truly hope he learns and grows to become a great developer, but right now, I do not think he is fitted for a raise after a majority of the work has been done by me.”

*Management:* “We have not heard this side of the story yet. Well, thank you for letting us know. We will consider your request and look into this situation more deeply.”

**Scripture:**
> Romans 12:19 [ESV]: “Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.””

**Response 3:** With the above verse, I think this situation requires a balance between making a case for myself and leaving it up to God. I absolutely should not be vengeful against the worker, but it also does not mean I should just let it be either.

## Conclusion:
This situation is interesting. On the one hand, there is a part of you that does not want to cause too much harm to the worker, but on the other hand, you also do not want him to receive credit for your own work. It is easy to fall into the ways of the world in this circumstance. We can fall into hate for the other person and become vengeful from him taking credit for what we have done. We can wish evil against him for, honestly, taking money that we feel is justly ours. This is not the way God calls us to respond, however. He wants us to handle things gently and with love. Because of that, the hardest decision in this situation may be the best.

## My Choice:
I might be cheating here, but I think the best choice might lie between choice 2 and 3. Choice 2 does not fully address the fact that the worker would, essentially, be stealing from work that is not his own. Choice 3 can be taken too strongly and cause some unwanted hatred. This is why I think that combining these choices would allow me to gently express the situation to management while also expressing why I believe my work should also be considered for a raise. It would keep the decision up to management, and it would get my case out there as well.
