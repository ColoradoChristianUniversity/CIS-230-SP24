## Response 1: Don’t include any pronouns or wear a pride pin

| **Pros**                                     | **Cons**                                        |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| - Does not feed into the sin of the world    | - Could stir up controversy within the workplace |
| - Shows where our beliefs lie               | - May cause HR issues                            |
| - May encourage others to reflect on beliefs | - May leave a sour taste in the mouths of non-believers |

**Script:**

*HR:* “Hey, I noticed that you are not wearing a pride pin and that you did not include any pronouns in your emails. Why is that?”

*Me:* “Well, I am a firm believer in Jesus Christ, and, to me, it is clear in the Bible that this type of thing does not align with what I believe. I mean no harm towards anyone, but I cannot support something that goes against my beliefs.”

*HR:* “Okay. We would have to discuss this with other HR employees, but we will take your viewpoint into great consideration.”

**Scripture:**
>1 Corinthians 6:9-11 [ESV]: “Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.”

**Principle 1:** The Bible is clear on its stance regarding homosexuality and sexual immorality. The LGBTQ+ community represents giving in to lust and sexual sin, which should not be something we support or encourage.

## Response 2: Email back to request a ‘middle ground’

| **Pros**                                     | **Cons**                                        |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| - Middle ground could satisfy both parties  | - May still be seen as controversial              |
| - Displays firmness in beliefs but remains rational | - May not fully align with personal preferences |
| - Aligns with the Bible if handled correctly |                                                 |

**Script:**

*Me:* “As per my personal beliefs, I cannot see it fit for me to wear a pride pin or include pronouns in my email. I understand that this is a move for inclusiveness, but is it possible for us to find a middle ground that both aligns with my beliefs and pertains to your intentions as a company?”

*HR:* “We understand. We will discuss with the rest of the team about this, but we do intend on being inclusive towards all people groups, including you. Let’s work together to solve this!”

**Scripture:**
>Romans 14:1 [ESV]: “As for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions.”

**Principle 2:** We are not called to attack everyone who holds non-biblical views. Such an approach can cause more harm than good. Jesus showed gentleness and rationality when interacting with people, and we should emulate that when dealing with such situations.

## Response 3: Push back and argue against the use of pronouns and pride pins

| **Pros**                                     | **Cons**                                        |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| - Pushes against the company's support of sin | - May come across as aggressive                    |
| - Clearly shows stance as Christians        | - Could result in HR issues or termination        |
|                                              | - May leave a sour taste in the mouths of non-believers |

**Script:**

*Me:* “I understand the move for having an all-inclusive environment, but for people like me whose beliefs do not align with what you are doing, it is actually making the environment less inclusive.”

*HR:* “As a company, we need to show support for all people groups.”

*Me:* “Yes, that makes sense, but for those of us who do not want to support the LGBTQ+ community, whether because it goes against our beliefs or we simply choose not to associate with it, forcing us to wear pins and include pronouns is unfair. This should be a personal choice, not a company mandate.”

*HR:* “Your viewpoint is valid. I will bring it up with the rest of the team, and maybe we can find a solution.”

**Scripture:**
>Mark 11:15-17 [ESV]: “And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple. And he was teaching them and saying to them, ‘Is it not written, "My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations"? But you have made it a den of robbers.’”

**Principle 3:** Sometimes, as in the verse above, Jesus took a firm stand to assert His beliefs. In certain circumstances, this approach may be necessary, though it must be executed with care.

## Conclusion:
A good balance is needed when dealing with such situations. Handle it with love and gentleness while remaining firm in Christian beliefs. Jesus never acted out of hate but approached people with love and understanding, regardless of their status. Similarly, companies must not enforce inclusive policies without considering the beliefs of other groups.

## My Choice:
I would choose response 2. Finding a middle ground is a reasonable approach since it respects all parties involved and allows us to maintain our beliefs. We must be careful not to compromise our beliefs, yet also show understanding and consideration for others' perspectives.
