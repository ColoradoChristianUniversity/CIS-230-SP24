## Response 1: Search for more context around the situation, then make a decision from there

| **Pros**                                       | **Cons**                                            |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| - Does not let you jump to conclusions         | - Will elongate the time it takes to take action   |
| - Allows you to make a more educated decision  |   if something bad is going on                      |

**Script:**

*Me:* “I noticed that the senior pastor does not give to the church directly. I just wanted to ask, is there a reason why he doesn’t? To me, it feels a little hypocritical and fishy if he encourages people to give to the church when he doesn’t do so.”

*Coworker:* “I also was wondering that. I learned that he runs a charity where he ministers to the homeless around the area. A lot of his money goes to that as well as some other medical needs he simply cannot avoid.”

*Me:* “Okay, I understand. I may encourage him to still try and cut out some income to provide to the church since it still seems a bit hypocritical but thank you for letting me know.”

**Scripture:**
>Proverbs 25:8 [ESV]: “do not hastily bring into court, for what will you do in the end, when your neighbor puts you to shame?”

**Principle 1:** There is always more context to a situation. Even when something looks bad on the surface, a lot of the time, there are unknown factors that drastically change how the situation looks. It is important to know those factors before making the next move.

## Response 2: Discuss the concern with the pastor directly

| **Pros**                                       | **Cons**                                            |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| - Settles the unknowns of the situation quickly| - May be seen as too drastic of a move              |
| - Directly voices concerns and point-of-view    | - May eliminate trust                               |
|   to the pastor                                |                                                     |

**Script:**

*Me:* “I was doing some work and looking at the giving records, and I noticed that there are no records of you providing directly to the church. Why is this?”

*Pastor:* “I have a lot of personal needs that must be met on top of having to pay for and help run the church, so I have not been able to do so.”

*Me:* “You encourage the church to give even if they may not fully be able to. This seems hypocritical on your end. I think you should follow what you tell your church to do.”

*Pastor:* “I understand, and you’re right. Thank you for voicing your concern, and I will be better about this next time.”

**Scripture:**
>1 Timothy 4:12 [ESV]: “Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.”

**Principle 2:** People who tell other people to do something a certain way must also live out what they teach. Especially for pastors, Christians must lead by example.

## Response 3: Ignore the concern with the assumption that the pastor is doing nothing wrong

| **Pros**                                       | **Cons**                                            |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| - Will not cause any unnecessary tension       | - Will not solve the problem if there is one        |
| - Will not cause overreacting                  | - Does not hold the pastor accountable              |
| - Will not let you jump to conclusions         | - May not fulfill your moral responsibility         |
|                                                |   as a Christian                                   |

**Script:**

*Me:* “The pastor has no record of him providing money to the church.”

*Coworker:* “Interesting. Why do you think that is?”

*Me:* “I don’t know. I am sure there is a reason behind it. I don’t think it’s a big deal. We all have other things to worry about.”

*Coworker:* “Fair enough. Let me know if you learn anything else.”

**Scripture:**
>Philippians 4:6-7 [ESV]: “do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.”

**Principle 3:** We do not need to stress or worry about our difficult situations since we have God on our side. He will handle them the way He needs to.

## Conclusion:
Not giving offerings to the church is not a salvation-breaking offense. This does not mean we should not give, as the Bible makes it clear that we are to give cheerfully. The pastor of the church should make an example of this in some way, especially if he encourages the church to do so. However, in this specific situation, there are not enough details to understand completely why the pastor is not giving. There could be a million explanations for this. Because of this, it is also not good to make any assumptions or to spread false rumors. The facts should be known before a move is taken. 

## My Choice:
I would choose choice 1. For this situation, there are simply not enough details to make a good, well-grounded decision on how to approach the problem. In order to make a decision that does not compromise the wellbeing or reputation of the pastor, it is crucial to know all of the facts beforehand. Once this is done, then I would go from there.
