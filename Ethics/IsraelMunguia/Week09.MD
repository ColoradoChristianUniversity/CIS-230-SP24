### Response 1: Bite the bullet and work extra on Sunday

| **Pros**                                     | **Cons**                                        |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| - Gives you time to fix the bug              | - Goes against your own Christian values for Sunday |
| - Shows commitment to work                   | - Takes some extra time on your end                |
| - Will not affect people using the system   |                                                 |

**Script:**
*Boss:* “Hey, just so you know, your new changeset implemented a bug that crashes the entire program. Is there any extra time you can take to fix it?”
*Me:* “Sorry about that. Yeah, I can take some time tomorrow to fix it.”
*Boss:* “I understand that you don’t wish to work on Sundays. Are you sure?”
*Me:* “Yes. It’s a pretty big mistake on my end, so I should try and fix it ASAP.”
*Boss:* “Great, thank you.”

**Scripture:**
2 Kings 22:5 [ESV]: “And let it be given into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the Lord, and let them give it to the workmen who are at the house of the Lord, repairing the house.”

**Principle 1:** When we do work, we need to do it well. When we make mistakes, we should not leave them be. There are numerous biblical examples of people addressing and fixing worldly mistakes, so we should do it too.


### Response 2: Don’t push your changes. Document what you did and revert back to an old changeset

| **Pros**                                     | **Cons**                                        |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| - Keeps all of your work                    | - Does not fully address/fix the issue            |
| - Does not implement the bug for users       | - Is a bit of a situational solution              |
| - Still keeps your Sunday open              |                                                 |

**Script:**
*Boss:* “Hey, just so you know, your new changeset implemented a bug that crashes the entire program. Is there any extra time you can take to fix it?”
*Me:* “Sorry about that. I do not work on Sundays, so I will just put all of my work on a document real quick and publish an old changeset for now. I will look at it on Monday.”
*Boss:* “Great, that should be fine. Thank you. Please let me know when you fix your code.”
*Me:* “Will do.”

**Scripture:** 
1 Corinthians 10:32 [ESV]: “So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.”

**Principle 2:** If we are to work for the glory of God, we should not deploy bad work. We should, rather, produce good work.


### Response 3: Quickly implement code that shuts off that part of the system that breaks. Deal with it on Monday

| **Pros**                                     | **Cons**                                        |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| - Keeps Sunday free                          | - Temporarily solves the problem                  |
| - Does not implement the bug for user use    | - May cause issues to crucial parts of the system |

**Script:**
*Boss:* “Hey, just so you know, your new changeset implemented a bug that crashes the entire program. Is there any extra time you can take to fix it?”
*Me:* “Sorry about that. I will comment out all of the new code I added in today and block off the program from accessing it. I will finish it up on Monday.”
*Boss:* “Okay. Please make sure you don’t break anything else by doing that.”
*Me:* “Will do.”

**Scripture:**
Exodus 12:16 [ESV]: “On the first day you shall hold a holy assembly, and on the seventh day a holy assembly. No work shall be done on those days. But what everyone needs to eat, that alone may be prepared by you.”

**Principle 3:** There should be the practice of implementing a day of rest every week, so on those days of rest, we need to do what we can to avoid work and fully put our focus on God.


### Conclusion:
As with everything, there should be a balance in this situation. We should produce work that glorifies God, meaning that it should be of high-quality and meet the expectations. We also, however, need to devote days of rest for full focus on God. Especially since our boss has accommodated for us so well in this situation, we should try our best to clear up this day of rest without sacrificing good work.

### My choice:
I would choose response 2 since it seems like the perfect middle ground. I keep my changes, but the program will not remain broken. I will also have my Sunday off still. Of course, this response assumes that the team is using a good SCM system that won’t sacrifice much by reverting back, but usually this seems like the case.
