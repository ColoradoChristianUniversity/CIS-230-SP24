## Response 1: Assign a zero on the assignment and tell the student to put the source in next time
**Pros:**

- Conveys that plagiarism is unacceptable
- Explains to the student why this is a problem

**Cons:**

- Student receives a 0
- Student-teacher relationship could be hindered

**Script:**

*Me:* “I noticed that your assignment is almost identical to this one tutorial video. Is this work truly yours?”

*Student:* “No, I guess not. I did follow a tutorial video for it.”

*Me:* “Well, that can be considered plagiarism, so I am going to assign a zero to your assignment per our academic policy. I apologize. Next time, make sure you put in the source you got the work from so that you don’t claim it as your work. You will have the opportunity to make up these points as well.”

*Student:* “Okay, thank you. I will make sure to do that next time.”

**Scripture:**

>Hebrews 12:11 [ESV]: “For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.”

**First Principle:** Discipline needs to be enforced when a biblically immoral act is committed. It is what helps people learn even though it seems bad in the moment.

## Response 2: Talk about the concerns with the student, but don’t do anything with the assignment

**Pros:**
- Student keeps the grade
- Shows the student that it is a serious matter
- Still upholds grace and a relationship with the student

**Cons:**
- May not be seen as disciplinary enough
- May not uphold the academic policy fully

**Script:**

*Me:* “I noticed that your assignment is almost identical to this one tutorial video. Is this work truly yours?”

*Student:* “No, I guess not. I did follow a tutorial video for it.”

*Me:* “I understand, but this is not your work. You are plagiarizing if you do not tell me that this is not your work. I will let you off with a warning this time, but if it happens again, you will receive a zero.”

*Student:* “I understand, thank you.”

**Scripture:**

>James 2:13 [ESV]: “For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.”

**Second Principle:** Grace and mercy should always be in the hearts of Christians. In this case, it may be helpful to show some grace to the student who made a genuine mistake. It also upholds CCU’s motto.

## Response 3: Assign a zero on the assignment, but allow a redo after a talk with the student

**Pros:**
- Allows the student to still do the assignment for a good grade
- Conveys the severity of the situation to the student
- Upholds grace and academic integrity

**Cons:**
- Forces the student to spend more time on the assignment
- Student could be annoyed

**Script:**

*Me:* “I noticed that your assignment is almost identical to this one tutorial video. Is this work truly yours?”

*Student:* “No, I guess not. I did follow a tutorial video for it.”

*Me:* “Well, that is plagiarism if you this work as your own. I will have to give you a zero on the assignment, but here is what I will let you do. You can redo it and turn it in next week for a better score, but if I find that you plagiarized again, you will get a zero.”

*Student:* “Okay, I understand. I will get it done as soon as I can.”

**Scripture:**
>1 John 1:9 [ESV]: “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”
Third Principle: Jesus is the master of second chances, and we are called to act in His ways. In this situation, the student gets a second chance to fix the first wrong, so it is a good disciplinary middle ground.

## Conclusion:
These types of situations need to balance discipline and grace. Both are necessary, as God has often used discipline towards people, yet has shown never-ending grace. The student needs to understand the moral severity of the mistake, but it cannot be in a way that is detrimental to the student. It is a good learning opportunity, and, after all, the job of the teacher is to teach students and prepare them for real life, not to academically harm them.

## My Choice:
It may seem like an odd choice, but I would probably choose option two if I was in this situation. This choice definitely lets the student off easy, but it still allows me to convey the importance of not plagiarizing while also giving the student mercy. I also think that using tutorial videos to help with homework is not necessarily a bad thing; it just can’t be taken too far. The student will understand the expectations moving forward, so if they do it again, they will be punished. Because of this, I would expect the student to not plagiarize in the future.
