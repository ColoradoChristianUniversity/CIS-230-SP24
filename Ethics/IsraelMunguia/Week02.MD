### Response 1: Request off of the project.

**Pros:**

- If the request is granted, you are not partially responsible for the laying off of employees

- The customer may reconsider the project and it’s consequences

**Cons:**
- Still will not fix the issue of the customer laying people off

- The request may not be granted, which would lead to more complications and decisions

**Script:**

*Boss:* “Hey, we need you to take on this project for our customer.”

*Me:* “I heard of the risks involved, and I don’t think I can support a project that will cause so many people to lose their jobs. Could I be put on a different project?”

*Boss:* “I understand. I will see what I can do.”

**Scripture:**

>Matthew 7:12 [NIV]: “So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.”

**First Principle:**
It is important to do what is right for others. Taking on this project may be seen as harmful towards others.

### Response 2: Take on the project.
**Pros:**

- Get to keep job

- Seen as loyal and cooperative to company

- Customer is satisfied and both parties benefit 
income-wise

**Cons:**

- Many people’s lives will be affected, and they may not be able to support themselves

- Your trustworthiness among your peers may diminish

**Script:**

*Boss:* “Hey, we need you to take on this project for our customer.”

*Me:* “Sure, that sounds like a good project.”

*Boss:* “Great. I am sure you are aware of the risks and potential outcomes. Have you thought about them?”

*Me:* “Yes, but it is a part of my job. I can start whenever you need.”

**Scripture:**
>James 5:12 [ESV]: “But above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath, but let your ‘yes’ be yes and your ‘no’ be no, so that you may not fall under condemnation.”

**Second Principle:**
When you make a promise to your company that you will do what your job requires you to, you should keep that promise. Plus, God calls us to work well and faithfully.

### Response 3: Talk to your boss about finding different solutions or paths with the project.

**Pros:**
- Will get your boss and the customer to understand the severity of the situation

- May create an outcome that is good for all parties involved

- Conforms to the obligations you may have as a Christian

**Cons:**

- No solution may be found, which leads to more complications and decisions

- Could be an expensive change

**Script:**

*Boss:* “Hey, we need you to take on this project for our customer.”

*Me:* “I heard about how the customer will probably lay off a lot of employees if this project is implemented. This project will change the lives of too many people. What if we think through other solutions to the problem and propose them to the customer?”

*Boss:* “I understand. We can try to brainstorm some different solutions. Let me get a meeting set up.”

**Scripture:**

>Hebrews 13:16 [NIV]: “And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.”

**Third Principle:**
We are called to do good towards other people. In order to do good towards others as well as our own family by keeping our job, doing all that we can to prevent the layoff of hundreds of employees should be in our best interest.

### Conclusion:
The project ultimately leads to the destructive harm of hundreds of people. Even though both companies would be benefiting, the companies will ultimately not be harmed if this solution is not implemented. This means that the moral obligation for a Christian in this situation is to protect those who are at risk of losing their job. Even though simply taking on the project is a valid decision, there is still the moral dilemma behind directly causing harm towards others.

### Decision:
In this situation, I choose option 3 because it is what may lead to the best outcome for all parties. If a better solution is found that will not compromise the jobs of dozens of employees, then everyone benefits. If the only solution is to do the project the way it was intended, then, to me, it may be worth requesting to do a different project.
