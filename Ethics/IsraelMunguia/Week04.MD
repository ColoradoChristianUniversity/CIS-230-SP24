I am going into this ethics assignment assuming a manager role.

### Response 1: Tell the team member to suck it up and do the job

**Pros:**

- The team member’s work in the project will not be lost
- Will still keep the customer

**Cons:**

- The team member will not get the help he needs
- The work quality and turnout may not meet the expectations
- Could be seen as insensitive

**Script:**

*Team Member:* “Hey man, this project is really heavy, and I have honestly been experiencing some heavy depression. It is starting to hinder my work. What should I do?”

*Me:* “Well, this is a really important project. We need you to do your part. I know it can be difficult, but I know you can do it. Try to just stay focused and let us know if you need anything.”

*Team Member:* “Okay, I understand. I will try my best.”

**Scripture:**

>Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 (NIV): “For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven: a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted; a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;”

**First Principle:** There are times of lows and times of highs. During those times, some responsibilities are unavoidable, so we need to keep our heads up and try our best to stay focused. This does not mean that we shouldn’t get help, however.


### Response 2: Put the worker on paid leave
**Pros:**

- Worker can get the help he needs
- He will have good work turnout when he gets better
- Puts the people over the company
- Is good for the team both for morale and expectations

**Cons:**

- Other team members would have to pick up the slack
- Could be risky for the company
- Uses company resources for little immediate turnout

**Script:**

*Team Member:* “Hey man, this project is really heavy, and I have honestly been experiencing some heavy depression. It is starting to hinder my work. What should I do?”

*Me:* “I am sorry to hear that. I don’t want your work to be hindered, and I want you to get better. It sounds like you need some time off. I will put you on leave and you can take some time to do whatever you need to get better.”

*Team Member:* “Thank you for understanding. I will let you know when I am good to come back, and I will try my best to make it speedy.”

*Me:* “Hope you get better soon.”

**Scripture:**
>Matthew 7:12 (ESV): “So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.”

**Second Principle:** If I was in that worker’s situation, I would not only want time off, but I would need time off. Working more would only make it worse, so I would want to get away from the project for a while.


### Response 3: Provide the worker with needed resources, including time off work if needed

**Pros:**

- Helps him get better
- Will not cause as many delays as if he were to just leave
- Shows the company will provide needed resources for workers

**Cons:**

- Uses company resources
- Could cause some project delays
- Company may not want to provide resources

**Script:**

*Team Member:* “Hey man, this project is really heavy, and I have honestly been experiencing some heavy depression. It is starting to hinder my work. What should I do?”

*Me:* “I am sorry to hear that. Well, we could really use your help on this project, but I know it can be very difficult for you to do your work. I will look into getting some therapy for you, and if you need some time off, just feel free to ask.”

*Team member:* “Thank you so much. I will try my best to stay focused, but I am sure that this will help me a lot.”

*Me:* “Of course. Keep me updated on how you are doing.”

**Scripture:**

>Acts 20:35 (ESV): “In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’”

**Principle 3:** As Christians, we are called to have compassion and give to those in need. In this case, a worker is weak and in desperate need of help, so we should try to do our part.


### Conclusion:
A worker’s wellbeing should be part of a manager’s best interest, especially as a Christian, not just because it is an obligatory action to take but because it will also make the work turnout better. Depression to this degree is not something to take lightly at all since it can be destructive to the worker. Even though that worker needs to do his part in the projects, there are some points where the line should be drawn. In my opinion, this line comes when the person starts to be harmed. This means that, overall, it becomes clear that the worker should receive help.


### My Choice:
In this situation, if I was a manager, I would choose option 3. It keeps the team member’s health as a priority, but it also gives room for the member to continue working on the project. It may use up some company resources, but the bottom line is that we are supposed to help and give to the weak, especially knowing that I would want the same to be done for me.
