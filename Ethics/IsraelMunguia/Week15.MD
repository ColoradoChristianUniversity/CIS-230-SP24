## Response 1: Talk with the customer to either confirm or deny your suspicions

| **Pros**                                           | **Cons**                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| - Shows a gentle approach to the possible issue    | - Will not immediately solve the problem            |
| - Does not jump to conclusions                    | - Might still hinder the opportunity with the coworker |
| - Will allow you to make a more educated decision |                                                     |

**Script:**

*Me:* “I have a concern about working with you guys. I just want to confirm that your products are not going to younger audiences that should not be accessing them.”

*Customer:* “I understand. While our product’s clientele is largely populated by younger people, we are absolutely not providing it illegally. We make sure to keep ourselves accountable in confirming the age of the consumer before confirming the buy.”

*Me:* “Great, thank you for letting me know. I look forward to doing work with you guys in the future.”

**Scripture:**
>Proverbs 25:8 [ESV]: “do not hastily bring into court, for what will you do in the end, when your neighbor puts you to shame?”

**Principle 1:** There is always context behind a situation. It is unwise and hypocritical to jump to conclusions without knowing all of the information, so we need to gather what we need to make a firm decision.

## Response 2: Take the moral stand, and wait for the coworker to inquire about it

| **Pros**                                           | **Cons**                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| - Grounds you morally in the issue                | - May be seen as a bit extreme by the coworker     |
| - Does not overly-push the agenda on the coworker | - Does not account for the need to confirm suspicions |
| - Exemplifies where you stand                    |                                                     |

**Script:**

*Coworker:* “Hey, I saw how you took a stand on the possibility that this company might be selling to underage people. Why did you do that? Do you know for sure that they are selling to these people?”

*Me:* “Well, as a Christian, I feel that I have a moral obligation to take a stand on issues like this. Even if they might not for sure be selling to these underage people, I think the company needs to make an effort to either clean up their reputation so that there is no suspicion that they are doing so, or they need to home in on making sure their product is not reaching that audience.”

*Coworker:* “Huh. I guess that makes sense. I still think it is a little extreme, but I understand your viewpoint.”

**Scripture:**
>1 Corinthians 16:13 [ESV]: “Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.”

**Principle 2:** As Christians, we need to be firm in the truth and take a stand in opposition to sin.

## Response 3: Do the work nonetheless

| **Pros**                                           | **Cons**                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| - Will keep good relationship with the customer    | - May not fix the problem if one exists             |
| - Will not create a sour taste in the mouth of the coworker | - Does not exemplify a moral stand           |
| - Gets the work done                              |                                                     |

**Script:**

*Coworker:* “I find it interesting that you are totally fine with working with this company. Don’t you have any concerns about this?”

*Me:* “Yeah, I do. I heard that they may be selling to underaged people. Eventually, that will come back to bite them. We have a job to do, so I will just do what I always do and provide my best work.”

*Coworker:* “Interesting. I guess that makes sense. Well, let me know if you need help with anything.”

**Scripture:**
>1 Peter 5:7 [ESV]: “Casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.”

**Principle 3:** Sometimes, it is better to let God take control rather than trying to control the situation ourselves.

## Conclusion:
This is an interesting situation. There are two sides: the side where we want to gently minister to a person possibly seeking God, and the side where we want to take a stand on our moral ground as Christians. As I always say, there is a balance with everything. As Jesus knew, some situations require firmness, and some require gentleness. However, before we can even handle this situation properly with gentleness or with firmness, we need to know everything about it first. We do not want to jump to conclusions and make a decision that will turn out to be the wrong one.

## My Choice:
My choice would be choice 1. We do not know for sure if the company is actually doing what we are thinking, so it is very unwise and hypocritical to just make assumptions. By acquiring more information about this topic, we can actually be confident in taking a stand on the subject.
