# Week Prompt

You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets. 

The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until put under the scrutiny of your tool. 

They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better secularize public places. 

You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years. 

The product manager speculates it could potentially be licensed to foreign governments in the future wanting to accomplish similar goals. However, you also have misgivings. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Answer

## <span style='color: red;'> Option 1: try to change licensing agreements</span>

| 👍 Pros: | 👎Cons: |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. The agreement would stipulate that the software can't be used to violate human rights (in this case religious liberty) | 1. This would only change the software's functionality on paper not in practice |
| 2. opens up the ability for legal action against anti-religious acts | 2. Who reads those license agreements anyway? |

Script:

    Me: It seems like our product may have the ability to identify religious symbols and that capability could be used to discriminate against those groups. It seems immoral to allow that especially if this is licensed to other countries

    coworker: That's a reasonable take we could change the licensing agreement and permissions to prevent stuff like that

    Me: Good idea. I just don't want myself or anyone else here to contribute to the genocide of the Uyghurs in China or other evil. 

📖 Scripture

>“Learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, and please the widow's cause” Isaiah 1:17

1️⃣ st Principle:

- prevent injustice through the legal system first

## <span style='color: red;'> Option 2: understand possible workarounds for christians </span>

| 👍 Pros: | 👎Cons: |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. When this is implemented Christians will more widely know how to keep areas Christianized | 1. The government is still discriminating against Christian spaces |
| 2. uses my unique insight into the model to work around evil implementation. | 2. Other countries probably won't have this information. |

Script:

    Me: A new LLM has been built and has the potential to discriminate against Christian symbols. Here are some general guidelines for creating branding, marketing, and promotional material so that it will not be filtered out by this software. 

📖 Scripture

>“In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted”  2 Timothy 3:12

1️⃣ st Principle:

- If we are to be persecuted we should still know how to best serve Christ through that. 

## <span style='color: red;'>Option 3: If the only use case for this software is religious discrimination then it has to be destroyed. </span>

| 👍 Pros: | 👎Cons: |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. I will not be complacent of the evil persecution of Christians. | 1. Potential that company and career would be destroyed |
| 2. | 2. Might be sued or something? |

Script:

    Me: The creation of this product would be exclusively used to de-Christianize the world. That is objectively evil and I cannot allow that to happen.

📖 Scripture

>“I will cut off your carved images  

And your _sacred_ pillars from among you,  

So that you will no longer bow down  

To the work of your hands.  

14 “I will root out your Asherim from among you  

And destroy your cities.  

15 “And I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath  

On the nations which have not obeyed.”  Micha 5:13-15

1️⃣ st Principle:

- Discrimination against Christians is evil. Don't be complicit in evil. 

# <span style='color: Orange;'> Excursus </span>

I interpret this situation as “A government agency has commissioned software for the express purpose of identifying and removing religious symbols through the country and potentially other countries.” If this interpretation is correct, then it is sort of shocking how evil this has the potential to be. There is no situation where it is moral to conceal the truth of Christ and his church. The goodness of God deserves to be proclaimed from all the mountain tops to all the alleys of the world and It is not moral to be complicit in preventing that. This sin is what destroyed Israel. We need to learn from our covenantal fathers and not make the same mistakes because it is convenient for us. 

If my situation is: “We have software that analyses images that has the potential to identify religious symbols for their removal” then I would have a much different response.

# <span style='color: Orange;'>My Choice </span>

If this software is for the expressed purpose of religious discrimination generally, then that means that our country will be further dechristianized, which has no upside. There is only evil when the name of the Lord is concealed. The Lord’s people constantly find themselves between what is convenient and what honors God. Choosing the easy path is what led to the destruction of Israel, the corruption of the German church in the 1940s, and countless other evils that we will be held accountable before God when we stand before him. There is not a universe in which I am complicit in something like this. This product shouldnt exist and should be distroyed.
