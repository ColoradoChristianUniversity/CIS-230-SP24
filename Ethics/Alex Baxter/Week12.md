# <span style='color: Orange;'>Excursus </span>
It is deeply unfortunate that Gender politics have emended themselves in every aspect of our lives. It feels now like Christians are in there Exile period and we are Daniel working for the Babylonians and the Assyrians. I believe our solutions be similar to his solutions. Do good work, but honor God first.

# <span style='color: Orange;'>My Choice</span>

I am most drawn to a stoic noncompliance. I would hope that my reputation with the company is positive enough that even if this is a barer to the people in HR or management liking me my work would hopefully speak for itself.  It is unfortunate that gender ideology has affected every aspect of our lives. However, I cannot stop everyone from there unfortunate beliefs. As long as I act within my personal moral convictions, be kind to others, and work as unto the Lord I believe I still honor God with my work.
