# Week Prompt

You are a software engineer working for a marketing firm that has been hired by a tobacco company to analyze data for a new product. 

Your team is excited to work on this project because it could save your struggling company during a bad economy. 

However, you suspect the customer is intending the product for young audiences, but you are not sure. 

To make matters worse, you have been trying to build a relationship with a coworker who has criticized religion as judgmental; 

you are worried that taking a moral stand against this product could come across as hypocritical and cause you to lose the opportunity to reach him just as he is softening to spiritual conversations. 

What are three possible responses? 

What do you do?

# Answer

## <span style='color: red;'> Option 1: Clarify what the intention of the company is. </span>

| 👍 Pros: | 👎Cons: |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. I can act with certainty afterward | 1. The company has no guarantee of communicating its intention. |
| 2. I can do better work after if I know what the client's goal is. | |

Script:

    Me: I was hoping to get some clarity on what our client's goals are. Do they have a specific market they are trying to gain an understanding of?

📖 Scripture

>"But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come." John 16:13

1️⃣ st Principle:

- If the spirit guides us in truth, then we should also seek truth to be guided by.

## <span style='color: red;'> Option 2: Work through my thinking with the coworker </span>

| 👍 Pros: | 👎Cons: |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Co-workers may see that I don't judge for judgment's sake | 1. Co-workers could reject this attempt and be closed off after this point |
| 2. I can try to communicate gospel truths | 2. If the co-worker and I really disagree this could push us further apart. |
| 3. Could discourage immoral decisions through calm sound logical reasoning | |

Script:

    Me: I wanted to see what your thoughts were on this new client. I am excited to have the business but I've been thinking about what they might want to do with the data we give them

    Coworker: Yeah I've had that same thought. A fella's gotta eat though. What do you think we should do?

    Me: I made a pro-con list in a markdown file. Here, take a look!

📖 Scripture

1️⃣ st Principle:

- Taking the time to listen to people and work through difficult problems is how you reach them.

## <span style='color: red;'>Option 3: Accept that people have agency</span>

| 👍 Pros: | 👎Cons: |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. I can just do the work | 1. If the company does plan on marketing to kids then I'm tangentially responsible for encouraging their bad habits |
| 2. Not pushing back might be seen as a non-judgmental act | 2. Younger audiences are more easily influenced by effective marketing |
| | 3. Not pushing back may be seen as a lack of real effective moral principles |

Script:

    Me: Here are the analytics on this new project! 

📖 Scripture

>**"I the LORD search the heart and examine the mind, to reward each person according to their conduct, according to what their deeds deserve." Jerimiah 17:10

1️⃣ st Principle:

- God allows people to choose destruction if that is what they want. 

# <span style='color: Orange;'> Excursus </span>

There is a certain amount of responsibility that companies have to their employees, their clients, and the larger world. All three of those areas could be represented as circles intersecting each other. A company whose business model is effectively distilled down to "profit by any means" without consideration of how it affects the world is not only a net negative to the world but also contributes to a dehumanizing company culture, where the employees themselves are seen as mere numbers. If a marketing company wants to take on a client that may be harmful to the world they must consider what that says about what their company's values are.

However, my personal view of tobacco products comes into play here. I enjoy the occasional and non-habitual cigar so I am not inclined to demonize the entire tobacco industry. I have also seen the effect of the early introduction of nicotine products to minors. The former of these scenarios is a net positive and the latter a massive negative. 

# <span style='color: Orange;'>My Choice </span>

I would seek clarity with the higher-ups about what the new product's intended audience is. Clarity is important not only for my conscience but also for doing the best work I can do. If I don't know the goals of my client then how am I supposed to serve them with my work? 

I would be excited to work on marketing a new cigar or brand of pipe tobacco whose audience is old and grizzled men. 

If after investigating, I discover this is a new product that could reasonably assumed to be for children I would be highly resistant to help on the project.
