# Excursus
Software can be a mentally taxing industry. It is quite common for problems to remain in the mental RAM of the minds of developers. I've heard many devs talk about waking up in the middle of the night or jumping out of the shower to try out a new solution to a week-long problem. This, in combination with WFH culture, can lead to poor work-life balance and burnout if combined with bad company culture. 

As Developers, our minds are the money makers and a mind that is overwhelmed with negative emotion won't operate at 100%. It must be the case then that we have to work especially hard on our mental health. We should live a life that allows us to understand our work and contribute to it meaningfully. We are all worth living a meaningful life and being proud of our work is part of that. 

As, Christians we are called to help the downtrodden and the tired. A coworker who has fallen upon hard times falls squarely within this criteria.



# My Choice

If we have a good manager I would bring this issue to them. It is generally their job to manage the developers and the project as a whole. They would have a better idea of what can be prioritized in a difficult situation like this. They are also more likely to be aware of resources the company may offer to coworkers. 

If I don't believe that our manager would be well equipt to handle this situation I would take this as an opportunity to love a neighbor and take on some of their assigned tasks. It may become an opportunity to share the gospel.
