# Week 1 Prompt

While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employer‚Äôs second largest customer: a well-known pornography website. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Answer

## Option 1: Refuse. Full Stop.

üëç Pros:

1. Might prevent some people from using the website while this issue goes unresolved.

2. Preventing payment to the company harms an evil company and may stop its proliferation in some small way.

3. Would sleep well at night.

üëé Cons:

1. Minimally, harms the relationship with the employer. More likely results in termination.

2. The issue will be solved by someone else eventually.

3. Because I work at a credit card company, the problem I have to fix doesn't actually prevent people from viewing pornography, just purchasing it. While this is still bad, it would be better to find a way to prevent anyone from viewing it entirely.

Script:

    Me: Hey boss, I am unable to complete this project you gave me.
    BossMan: Is it something technical? I'm sure your scrum master might be able to figure it out.
    Me: Nah, it's a moral issue. I don't think we should fix this.
    BossMan: It might be time we reconsider your employment.

üìñ Scripture

>"Abstain from every form of evil." 1st Thessalonians 5:22

1Ô∏è‚É£ st Principle:

- Prevent or stop evil at every cost.

## Option 2: Pass off to another Developer

üëç Pros:

1. I am still not technically the person responsible for helping a company that objectively harms the world.

2. Maintain a better relationship with the company.

3. Sleep well at night.

üëé Cons:

1. Another developer now has the burden.

2. Pornography is still distributed.

Script:

    Me: Hey coworker, are there any projects you're working on that I could take off your hands? I was given this project and I can't do it. Could we trade projects?
    Coworker: Yeah, sounds fine. I'll send you what I have for this other client.
    Me: I'll send over what I have. Let me know if you need something else.

üìñ Scripture

>"Bondservants, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, with a sincere heart, as you would Christ," Ephesians 6:5

1Ô∏è‚É£ st Principle:

- Two good things make a better thing. Continuing to work is good. Not personally facilitating pornography is good.

## Option 3: Resolve the problem yourself

üëç Pros:

1. No conflict with anyone.

2. Solving a problem that could be interesting.

üëé Cons:

1. Regret life decisions.

2. Betray personal convictions and testimony.

3. Restless.

Script:

    Boss: Hey buddy, I need you to fix this big issue with ______ company.
    Me:...
    Boss: Is everything okay? It needs to be fixed as soon as you can.
    Me: Yeah, I'll handle it.

üìñ Scripture

>"All hard work brings a profit, but mere talk leads only to poverty." Proverbs 14:23

1Ô∏è‚É£ st Principle:

- Work is work. I am not actively advertising or producing pornography, so it is not morally wrong to fix a problem for the company.

# Excursus

Just like most moral dilemmas, a lot of the solutions live in the details. Questions like:\
"Do I need this job to feed my children?", \
"Am I happy with the company other than this one event?", \
"Am I building a lot of positive relationships that I can use to spread the gospel further." \
A higher definition context in addition to continual prayer and fasting would make the decision clearer.

Additionally, In this scenario, I work for a credit card company. I am likely doing something that processes the transactions between the website's customers and the website. If I work to make those transactions function properly, then I believe that I am further disconnected from the proliferation of pornographic content. If I were working for a networking company that actually hosted the website, my position would be different.

# My Choice

Without any additional information, I am inclined to choose option 2. It seems to cover most of my moral bases while also maintaining positive relationships with coworkers.

In writing this, I realize that I have a mental connection between doing what other people tell me to do and maintaining a positive relationship with those people. This may be a false or harmful assumption for me to make.
