# Week # Prompt

  While maintaining an extremely popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three responses? What do you do?

    Note: an open-source maintainer is a volunteer who owns a repository others contribute to. The repository, if popular, will be used in many software programs either as reference or as a library. A company does not own an open-source project.

## Option 1: Talk to Contibuters

| üëç Pros: | üëé Cons: |
|----------|-----------|
| 1. Open communication with other devs	  |1. If the other devs are against it I won't be able to help	 |
|2. More wisdom from more people       |2. Users are out of the loop	|
|3. monitoring what other libraries might copy the vulnerability would be easier	||
|


Script:

    Me: Hey friends, The authorities want us to put in a loophole that might help stop child trafficking. What do you think?
    Contibuters: How can they guarantee that they would be the only ones using it? and that they are using it for that purpose?
    Me: I'll run those by those the people who contacted me.

1Ô∏è‚É£ st Principle:

- Communication with the people you work with is always better when it is open and you don't do what is right in your own eyes.

## Option 2: Lone Wolf Approch

| üëç Pros: | üëé Cons: |
|----------|-----------|
|  1. Maximal secrecy for maximal predator catching | 1.Creates a backdoor without anyone's knowledge	  |
| 2. No way devs can shoot the idea down           | 2. Might look like negligence on my part if another dev catches it	 |
|                                                   |3.  Feds are unmonitored with what they do with the granted access	 |
||4. Reference libraries will be unknowingly affected	|
|

Script:

    Police: Please give us a back door into this program you contribute to. It will save the lives of children.
    Me: YES.

1Ô∏è‚É£ st Principle:

- Do everything possible to save the most children.

  ## Option 3: Simple post to community or documenation

|üëç Pros:|üëé Cons:|
|-------------|-------------------|
|1.  Still acting within the principles of FOSS|1. harm popularity|
|2. anyone who checks will be aware of the vulnerability|2. might not be able to catch traffickers if they move to use a different project
|3.  care off traffickers from using the sight||
|


Script:

    Devs:We have decided to work with authorities and will update the docs soon.
    Docs: we have included a vulnerability that only the authorities have access to. This project should be copied carefully if you plan to use it in your projects. 
    Users: While this is not ideal, we understand your reasoning.

# Excursus

The open-source community is notoriously picky about who they trust with their data and with what projects they use. Many anti-establishment programmers refuse to use anything that they can't see the code for. It must be with great care and responsibility that a person must maintain a FOSS project.
The government is also notoriously very bad at working within confines. They frequently violate the rights of liberty and privacy of their citizens so providing an additional way for them to gather more information about innocent civilians is also not ideal.


  

# My Choice

OPTION 3: It is a very close choice between 1 and 3, but I believe that 3 would be the ideal. Open-source projects should always communicate their intentions openly. This is especially true when the code in one open-source project will affect the code of many others. Protecting people's data is important and any vulnerability, even for a good cause, can have many unintended consequences. It would be best to create a post in the README or other documentation explaining the choice and potential measures that have been taken to prevent a user of that vulnerability from exploiting it beyond what is reasonable.
While the Police's case is good it is my responsibility to do the best possible work on every project and communicate why I do that work clearly.
