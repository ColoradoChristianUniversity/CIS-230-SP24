# Week 4 Ethics Response
### Question:
While working on a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three responses? What do you do?


### 1) Offer to take on some of your teammate’s workload.
### Pros
- Shows compassion and support for your teammate during a difficult time.
- Helps alleviate some of the pressure and stress your teammate may be feeling.
- Strengthens trust and camaraderie within the team.

### Cons
- Might not fully address the underlying issues of your teammate's depression.
- Could potentially put more strain on yourself and impact your own work performance.
- Your teammate may decline your offer, feeling uncomfortable accepting help.

### Scripture
>“Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.” - Galatians 6:2
### Script
- Me: "Hey, I appreciate you opening up to me. I'm here to support you. How about I take on some of your workload to lighten the burden?"
- teammate: "Thank you, I appreciate it. I'll let you know which tasks I can delegate."
- Me: “Take all the time you need. We're in this together.”

### Principle: 
Compassion and teamwork are essential in supporting colleagues facing personal challenges, especially in high-pressure situations.
### 2) Report this to HR.
### Pros
- Ensures that your teammate receives the necessary support and resources from the company.
- HR can provide guidance on how to handle the situation sensitively and appropriately.
- Helps protect the well-being of both your teammate and the project.

### Cons
- Your teammate may feel betrayed or violated if they wanted to keep their depression private.
- Could potentially create tension or mistrust within the team.
- HR's involvement may lead to confidentiality concerns or unintended consequences.

### Scripture
>“Listen to advice and accept discipline, and at the end you will be counted among the wise.” - Proverbs 19:20
### Script
- Me: "I appreciate you trusting me with this information, but I think it's important for HR to be aware so they can support you better."
- teammate: "I would like to wait a day or two before that, please understand that I want to keep this as private as possible."
- Me: “I do understand but I think talking to one person in HR and having them keep it confidential would be wise.”

### Principle: 
Prioritizing the well-being and support of your teammate, while also recognizing the need for professional assistance in handling sensitive issues.

### 3) Keep on working on the project and take no further action regarding your coworker.
### Pros
- Maintains focus on completing the project and meeting deadlines.
- Avoids potentially awkward or uncomfortable conversations with your teammate.
- Preserves the confidentiality of your teammate's struggles.

### Cons
- Neglects the emotional well-being of your teammate, potentially worsening their condition.
- Could contribute to a toxic work environment where employees feel isolated and unsupported.
- Risks the project's success if your teammate's performance is significantly impacted by their depression.

### Scripture
>“Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.” - Galatians 6:9
### Script
- Me: "Okay, let's continue with our tasks and stay on track."
- Teammate: "Okay, just don’t get mad at me please, I am trying my hardest."
- Me: “I respect your effort and will expect you to be able to carry on, thanks for keeping me informed.” 

### Principle: 
Focusing solely on your own responsibilities and allowing your teammate to overcome his obstacles will give him a long term reward of confidence and self respect.

#### Conclusion
Navigating the delicate balance between professional obligations and personal compassion can be challenging, especially when faced with a situation like a teammate confiding in you about their struggles with depression amidst high-pressure work circumstances. In considering the ethical responses outlined above, it becomes apparent that each option carries its own set of considerations and potential outcomes. I think that the best way to choose is to be both instinctual and thoughtful about it.

#### My Final Choice
I believe that offering to take on some of my teammate's workload while also encouraging them to seek professional support, such as from HR, is the most balanced and compassionate approach. This choice goes along with biblical principles of bearing one another's burdens (Galatians 6:2) and seeking wise counsel (Proverbs 19:20). By extending support to my teammate and others in my team and advocating for their well-being through both practical assistance and professional guidance, I can uphold the values of empathy, teamwork, and accountability in the face of challenging circumstances.
