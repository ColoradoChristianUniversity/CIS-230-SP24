# Week 3 Ethics Response
### Question:
While maintaining an extremely popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three responses? What do you do?
Note: an open-source maintainer is a volunteer who owns a repository others contribute to. The repository, if popular, will be used in many software programs either as reference or as a library. A company does not own an open-source project.

### 1) Refuse to introduce the back door.
### Pros
- Upholding the integrity of the open-source project and maintaining trust within the developer community.
- Avoiding potential legal ramifications and ethical dilemmas associated with compromising user privacy and security.
- Sets a precedent against government overreach and preserving the principles of user autonomy and digital rights.

### Cons
- Facing potential pressure or consequences from authorities for non-compliance, including legal action or surveillance.
-Risking public backlash or negative publicity, which could impact the project's reputation and user base.
-Potentially hindering law enforcement efforts to combat serious crimes such as child trafficking, leading to moral conflict and guilt.
### Scripture
>“Those who guard their mouths and their tongues keep themselves from calamity.” Proverbs 21:23
### Script
- Me: "I understand the gravity of the situation, but introducing a back door goes against the core principles of our project and compromises user security."
- Authorities: "This is a matter of national security, and lives are at stake. We need your cooperation to put an end to this illegal activity."
- Me: “I sympathize with the urgency, but I cannot compromise the trust of our users and the integrity of our project. Is there something else we could do to track this activity?”

### Principle: 
Upholding integrity and ethical standards, even in the face of pressure, ensures the preservation of trust and principles for the online community.
### 2) Seek legal advice outside the authorities before introducing the back door.
### Pros
- Seeking legal advice helps assess the potential legal implications and safeguards against any unintended consequences or liabilities.
- Enables informed decision-making by understanding the legal framework and ethical considerations surrounding the request.
- Shows that you will not be forced by the government to infringe on the privacy of an open server without doing your due diligence beforehand.

### Cons
- Legal advice may not provide a clear solution and could lead to conflicting recommendations, prolonging the decision-making process.
- Introducing the back door, even with legal counsel, still raises ethical concerns regarding user privacy and security.
- Risk of legal repercussions if the decision to introduce the back door is deemed unlawful or unethical, despite legal consultation.

### Scripture
>“The way of fools seems right to them, but the wise listen to advice.” Proverbs 12:15
### Script
- Me: "Before making a decision, I believe it's best to seek legal counsel outside of the authorities to fully understand the implications and ensure we're acting within legal and ethical boundaries."
- Authorities: "Time is of the essence. We need to act swiftly to combat this heinous crime. Are you suggesting further delay?"
- Me: “I understand the urgency, but it's essential to proceed cautiously to avoid any potential legal or ethical pitfalls. We owe it to our users and the broader community to make an informed decision.”
### Principle: 
Engaging legal counsel outside of the requesting authorities ensures impartial guidance and adherence to legal and ethical principles, promoting accountability and integrity in decision-making.


### 3) Introduce the back door.
### Pros
- Potentially aiding law enforcement in stopping a serious criminal activity, and potentially saving lives.
- Demonstrating cooperation with authorities and fulfilling civic duty by assisting in the enforcement of laws and protection of society.
- Minimizing potential legal repercussions for not obeying the authorities.
### Cons
- Compromising the integrity and security of the open-source project, leading to distrust among users and potential exploitation by malicious actors.
- Setting a dangerous precedent of government overreach and undermining individual privacy rights and digital freedoms.
- Contributing to a slippery slope where similar requests for back doors in the future may become more frequent and difficult to resist.
### Scripture
>”Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.” Isaiah 5:20 
### Script
- Me: "I understand the seriousness of the situation, and while it goes against our principles, I will introduce the back door as requested."
- Authorities: "Thank you for your cooperation. Lives are at stake, and your assistance in this matter is crucial."
### Principle: 
The principle of balancing societal obligations with ethical considerations underscores the difficult decision to prioritize immediate societal good over potential long-term consequences. The following of this request now may lead to less protective breaches of privacy in the future.

#### Conclusion
In conclusion, the ethical dilemma faced by the open-source maintainer reveals the profound tension between societal obligations and individual principles. Each response—refusing to compromise integrity, seeking legal counsel, or introducing the back door—illustrates the important considerations one must take in such situations. Ultimately, the decision reflects not only the immediate impact on combating crime but also the broader implications for privacy, trust, and digital rights. By carefully weighing these factors and adhering to guiding principles, individuals navigate the complex landscape of ethics and responsibility, striving to uphold integrity while addressing pressing societal challenges.

#### My Final Choice
After deliberation, I have chosen to seek legal advice before the introduction of a back door into the open-source project. This decision reflects my commitment to thorough consideration of the legal and ethical implications of our actions. By consulting external counsel, I aim to navigate this complex dilemma responsibly, ensuring that our choices align with both legal requirements and ethical principles. Upholding integrity and preserving user trust remain paramount as we explore avenues to address the urgent concerns raised by authorities while safeguarding the fundamental values of our project and community.
