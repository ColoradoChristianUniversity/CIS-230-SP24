# Week 14 Ethics Response
## Question:
You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets. The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until put under the scrutiny of your tool. They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better secularize public places. You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years. The product manager speculates it could potentially be licensed to foreign governments in the future wanting to accomplish similar goals. However, you also have misgivings. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


## **Answer**
## Option 1: Fight for policies that would restrict this course of action by different governments.


| Pros  | Cons |
| :---: | :---: |
| This course supports my ethical principles by advocating against the use of technology for harmful purposes. | It may face resistance from stakeholders who care more about profits than anything else. |
| This promotes accountability in the development and use of technology. | I could be straining relationships with the government agency. |
| This aligns with good efforts to protect religious freedom. | This might be very challenging and may not stop misuse of the technology. |


### Scripture:
> “Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy.” - Proverbs 31:8-9


## **Script:**
**Me:** "The idea of others using our machine to suppress religion is cary for sure. I believe we should think about promoting a policy that restricts such actions by different governments."


**Boss:** "I see your point, this might be a good thing to do and look good for our brand. Let’s do it!"


**Me:** "Thank you sir."




## Principle: It is important to fight for your values and for those who don’t know what’s going on behind the scenes. I would want any person from any religion to do the same for me. As a warning, I would say that this might put a target on your business from the government.




## Option 2: Do not intervene and surrender the matter to the Lord’s will.


| Pros  | Cons |
| :---: | :---: |
| This releases control and places trust in God's sovereignty. | It might contribute to the misuse of technology. |
| This is avoiding potential conflicts or tensions in the workplace. | It will likely lead to feelings of guilt over not taking a stand. |
| This aligns well with placing full trust in God. | It fails to actively engage in efforts to uphold righteousness. |


### Scripture:
> “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight." - Proverbs 3:5-6


## **Script:**
**Me:** "Hey, I have decided to surrender this matter to the Lord's will and trust that He will guide the outcome."


**Colleague:** "Yeah, in these matters, the government needs to be checked in my opinion, but if you believe that surrendering it to God is the move, you should follow your beliefs."


**Me:** "Thank you."


## Principle: By giving things up to God, we are showing our faithfulness to his perfect plan. My one warning with this course would be to dwell on the situation a lot before just deciding to do nothing.




## Option 3: Share my concerns with my colleagues and request that we build the learning tool, so that it internally prohibits this action. 


| Pros  | Cons |
| :---: | :---: |
| This will promote collaboration in decision-making. | Implementation may be technically challenging and cause it to not work well. |
| This shows that I am willing to go above and beyond for the freedom of others. | It might face opposition from colleagues who prioritize performance over ethical issues. |
| This encourages accountability in the team and fosters a culture of integrity. | It will delay the project timeline. |


### Scripture:
> “Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets." - Matthew 7:12


## **Script:**
**Me:** "I have concerns about the potential misuse of our technology for suppressing religious references. Can we build safeguards into the machine to prevent this action?"


**Colleague:** "That might complicate things, but I see your point. Let's discuss it further with the team."


## Principle: God calls us to obey Him above all others, this may be one of those times when I must go against the government's desires and support religious freedom.


## **Excursus**
While dealing with the problem of developing technology to identify religious references in public spaces, I feel like there are a few good options. Option 1 would allow me to advocate for policies safeguarding religious freedom, despite potential challenges. Option 2, requires a lot of prayer before choosing. It shows faith in the Lord and hope for things to turn out for the best. Option 3 advocates for collaboration within my team to build safeguards against misuse. This is something that would feel useless in some ways since the government agency could always write laws to override us if we rebelled fully. Each path presents its challenges and virtues, highlighting the need for approaching technology problems with integrity and foresight.


## **My Final Choice**
I've decided to fight for policies that restrict the use of our technology for suppressing religious references. This aligns with my beliefs and shows a commitment to defending the rights of others. While it may pose challenges, I believe it's crucial to stand up for what’s right and promote accountability in the creation of such a tool. This choice seems like the best choice to me since I am a big advocate of helping those who cannot help themselves. I also think that it will be good PR if we leaked the information in the right way.
