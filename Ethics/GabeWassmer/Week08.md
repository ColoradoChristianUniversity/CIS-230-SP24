# Week 8 Ethics Response
## Question:
While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he is up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## **Answer**
## Option 1: Report your concerns of this scenario to the company before they give my mentee the raise.
### **Pros:**
- Upholds honesty and integrity in the workplace.
- Protects the integrity of the work done by each person.
- Demonstrates accountability to company leadership.

### **Cons:**
- Risk of straining relationships with the mentee and potentially facing backlash.
- Potential for creating tension within the team.
- Uncertainty of how company leadership will react or handle the situation.

### Scripture:
>“Don't lie to each other, for you have stripped off your old sinful nature and all its wicked deeds.” - Colossians 3:9

## **Script:**
**Me:** “I have some concerns about the credit distribution for our recent projects. It seems there may have been a misunderstanding regarding the contributions made by the team.”

**Management:** “Please elaborate. We want to be fair to everyone and encourage hard work and excellence.”

**Me:** “I believe there may be a misconception that my mentee solely completed the work, whereas it was a collaborative effort.”

## Principle:
Uphold honesty and integrity, even when faced with difficult decisions, to maintain trust and transparency in all relationships.

## Option 2: Do nothing and allow the company to give the raise to my mentee.

### **Pros:**
- Avoids potential conflict or confrontation with the mentee.
- Allows the mentee to make big oportunity to show integrity.
- Allows the company to make its own decisions without interference.

### **Cons:**
- Compromises on honesty and integrity by allowing false credit to be given.
- Could lead to feelings of resentment or injustice among team members.
- Sets a precedent for unethical behavior to go unaddressed in the future.

### Scripture:
>“Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.” – Galatians 6:7

## **Script:**
**Me:** “You’ve made some contributions on this project. Just remember, it's important to always stay true to yourself and your values, even in moments like these.”

**Mentee:** “I will. Thanks for being there, I appreciate it.”

## Principle: 
Strive for harmony and peace, but never compromise your values. Resolve conflicts peacefully while upholding truth and integrity. 

## Option 3: Advise the junior to mention this fact to the managers, and allow them to take it into account.

### **Pros:**
- Empowers the mentee to take responsibility for their actions.
- Encourages open communication and transparency within the team.
- Allows the company to make an informed decision based on all relevant information.

### **Cons:**
- Mentee may feel embarrassed or resentful for being put in this position.
- Risk of damaging trust or rapport between mentor and mentee.
- Uncertainty about how the company will handle the situation and potential consequences for the mentee.

### Scripture:
>“Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.” - 2 timothy 2:15

## Script:
**Me:** "I understand this might be uncomfortable, but it's important to address this with our managers. Honesty and integrity are essential."

**Mentee:** "I appreciate your guidance, I'll talk to them about it."

**Me:** "I'll support you through this process. Potentially there is an area in the company that suits your passions better than this one, and that position could hold benefits better than these."

## Principle:
Encourage accountability and responsibility, empowering others to take ownership of their actions with honesty and integrity.

## **Excursus**
Week 8's ethical responses give us a peek into the balancing act professionals often face between honesty, peacekeeping, and accountability. Option 1 says "keep it real" by reporting concerns, while Option 2 takes the "live and let live" approach, hoping things sort themselves out. Option 3 nudges towards personal responsibility but also respects the freedom to choose. It's like a mini-drama of workplace dynamics, teaching us about the importance of sticking to our moral compass while navigating tricky situations.

## **My Final Choice**
After weighing the options and reflecting on my values, I've decided to go with Option 1. While it might stir up some discomfort and tension, I can't compromise on honesty and integrity. Reporting my concerns to the company is the right thing to do, not just for myself but for the integrity of the work done by others in the company that may work with my mentee. It's about holding ourselves accountable and ensuring that credit is given where it's due. It won't be an easy conversation, but I'm committed to upholding the truth and maintaining trust within the team.
