# Week 11 Ethics Response
## Question:
While volunteering to help with computers at your church, you are given access to giving records. Because of your work, you unexpectedly discover your senior pastor does not give anything to your church. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


## **Answer**
## Option 1: Confront my pastor directly to question him about the matter.


| Pros  | Cons |
| :---: | :---: |
| By direct communication, I may get clarification and resolution. | This course might cause strain between the pastor and myself. |
| It upholds the principle of accountability and integrity within the church community. | Could potentially create tension within the church community if not handled discreetly and with love. |
| Provides an opportunity for the pastor to address any misunderstandings or reasons behind his actions. | The pastor may feel offended, leading to a negative outcome. |


### Scripture:
> “If your brother or sister[a] sins,[b] go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over.” -Matthew 18:15


## **Script:**
**Me:** "Hello Pastor Matt, I noticed while going through the giving records that there were no contributions from your account. Can you help me understand why?"


**Pastor:** "I appreciate your concern, but that's a personal matter. It's between me and God."


**Me:** "I understand, but as a leader in the church, your example is important to many. Transparency could help alleviate any misunderstandings."


**Pastor:** "That’s true, I will contact the elders about the matter and we’ll discuss it further."


## Principle: Direct communication guided by love and humility is essential in resolving conflicts within the church. It is also important to trust my Pastor. But in a case like this, it may be important to go to others about your concerns if the Pastor is defensive.




## Option 2: I could go to the Elders of the church and report the matter.


| Pros  | Cons |
| :---: | :---: |
| This would involve other trusted leaders in addressing the issue, providing a balanced perspective. | It may create division among the leadership if not approached carefully. |
| This course shares the burden of responsibility. | This could lead to rumors or gossip within the church community if handled insensitively. |
| It helps maintain confidentiality and professionalism in addressing the concern. | The pastor may feel undermined by involving others without prior discussion. |


### Scripture:
> “Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses. But those elders who are sinning you are to reprove before everyone, so that the others may take warning.” -1 Timothy 5:19-20


## **Script:**
**Me:** "Elders, I have a concern regarding the giving records of our pastor."


**Elders:** "What is the concern?"


**Me:** "I noticed that there were no contributions from his account. I think it's something we should address."


## Principle: This would be a prudent way to go about a delicate situation, The Bible takes the actions of church leaders seriously, and going to elders with authority in the church would be wise.




## Option 3: I could do nothing, because the act of tithing is between the Lord and the individual. 


| Pros  | Cons |
| :---: | :---: |
| This option respects the pastor's privacy and autonomy in matters of personal finance and faith. | If it comes out another way, it may lead to feelings of resentment among church members who expect their leaders to set an example. |
| It avoids potential conflict or misunderstanding within the church. | It fails to get anything done on my end which might be what God is looking for. |
| It offers the matter up to God’s will which can be the best option in some cases. | This could build a habit of not speaking up about important matters. |


### Scripture:
> “Cast your cares on the Lord and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous be shaken.” -Matthew 18:15


## **Script:**
**Me:** "I appreciate the initiative for inclusivity, but I would prefer to express my beliefs through my religion and wear a cross instead."


**Pastor:** "I understand your perspective, but we're aiming for a unified approach to celebrating diversity. Would you wear a rainbow and a cross?"


**Me:** "I cannot do that, I must maintain the ideals of my faith."


**Management:** "I see, I believe we will have to let you go."


## Principle: Sometimes trusting in God's sovereignty and allowing Him to work in the hearts of individuals is essential, even when faced with challenges within the church.




## **Excursus**
Encountering ethical issues in church settings made me think about a balance between accountability and grace. These options reveal the importance of transparency and leading by example, while the options highlight the complexities involved. It's a reminder of the need for thinking carefully, and a reliance on God's guidance as we navigate such challenges within our churches. I personally would feel like a very hard situation had been forced on me, and it would take a while to come to the best resolution.


## **My Final Choice**
For my final decision, I have chosen to confront my pastor directly about the matter. While this decision may pose challenges, I believe it aligns with the values of accountability and integrity within our church community. My pastor and I have a good relationship and I would hope that this type of conversation could be something that is not so gossip oriented, and more to the point. By approaching the pastor with humility and a desire for clarification, I aim for clarity and to address any potential misunderstandings.
