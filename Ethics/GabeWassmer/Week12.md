# Week 11 Ethics Response
## Question:
While working your dream job for a major engineering firm, you get an email from HR: immediately put your "preferred pronouns" in your email signature and show up this Thursday with a üåà rainbow pin to help celebrate diversity and inclusion. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


## **Answer**
## Option 1: Do what the email says and be as loving as possible to all involved.


| Pros  | Cons |
| :---: | :---: |
| This demonstrates respect for company policies and values.  | This type of requirement may cause discomfort and awkwardness for some.|
| This would show that you are willing to be an inclusive co-worker. | This could be perceived as conforming to something without personal conviction.|
| Helps maintain good relations with colleagues that feel discriminated against. | This does not align well with biblical truths. |


### Scripture:
>"Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another." - John 13:34


## **Script:**
**Me:** "Certainly, I'll update my email signature and wear the rainbow pin on Thursday."


**Boss:** "Thank you for your cooperation. We appreciate your support for diversity and inclusion."


**Me:** "I am still a Christian with certain beliefs, but this does seem to offer a good course of loving my neighbors."


## Principle:
Navigating job requirements can be scary. The warning I would offer with a solution like this is that you are celebrating something God is against, so it may be that this solution falls short of what God desires.


## Option 2: Refuse to do all of what the email is requesting, I would show up on Thursday with love for all regardless of their sins.


| Pros  | Cons |
| :---: | :---: |
|This solution upholds Biblical truths and my beliefs in many ways. | This could lead to tension or conflict within the workplace. |
|Doing this would demonstrate a commitment to principles regardless of external pressures. | It may be perceived as resistant to company policies.|
|This allows for genuine expression of love and acceptance towards others.|This could also show that I do not want to be a loving person|


### Scripture:
>"Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you." - Deuteronomy 31:6


## **Script:**
**Me:** "I appreciate the request, but I cannot comply with it based on my personal beliefs."


**Management:** "I understand your position. However, we encourage all employees to participate in diversity initiatives."


**Me:** "I will continue to show love and respect to all my colleagues, regardless of our differences."


## Principle:
This type of solution comes at the cost of potentially losing my dream job and showing my true self. But that is what God calls us to do every day, even at the cost of worldly benefits.


## Option 3: Refuse, and request that I am able to put my religion in my email, and wear a cross instead of a rainbow in order to celebrate life in my own way. 
| Pros  | Cons |
| :---: | :---: |
|This also asserts personal religious beliefs and values. | It may be seen as divisive or exclusive by some colleagues.|
|Allows for individual expression while still participating in the celebration.| This choice could definitely lead to a firing. |
|Opens the door for dialogue and understanding between different perspectives.| Might lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of intentions.|


### Scripture:
>"For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery." - Galatians 5:1


## **Script:**
**Me:** "I appreciate the initiative for inclusivity, but I would prefer to express my beliefs through my religion and wear a cross instead."


**Management:** "I understand your perspective, but we're aiming for a unified approach to celebrating diversity. Would you wear a rainbow and a cross?"


**Me:** "I cannot do that, I must maintain the ideals of my faith."


**Management:** "I see, I believe we will have to let you go."


## Principle:
As Christians, we ultimately answer to the Lord our God. We are called to stand firm in the event of adversity and remember that Jesus is the way. 


## **Excursus**
When a manager or boss asks me to wear my beliefs on my sleeve, it's a tricky spot. I could go with it, stand my ground, or try to meet halfway. No matter what, though, staying true to my faith is key. We are called to take up our cross daily, and that can mean setting aside earthly ambition. To me, there is no sweet spot between holding onto what I believe and celebrating something I do not believe, even when it's a tough call. The tricky part is maintaining that I still hold an equal love for the people that choose to celebrate this sin. 


## **My Final Choice**
For my final decision, I've decided to stand firm in my faith. While I see why management desires to pursue the diversity initiatives, I can't compromise on what I believe. So, I'll go with option 3, kindly decline to participate in the specific requests regarding pronouns and symbols, while requesting to pursue a different course. I'll continue to show love and respect to all my colleagues, regardless of our differences. My cross that I will wear will hopefully inspire conversation and understanding. Maybe this is naive, but it seems like the most ‚Äútrue to my Lord‚Äù approach. This decision may come with its challenges, but I'm confident that staying true to my convictions is worth it in the long run.
