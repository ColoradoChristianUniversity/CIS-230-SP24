# Week 6 Ethics Response
### Question:
The root of this site has the ethics write-up of everyone in class. You can go there, and you can browse and read anyone's essays. Looking back on the first 5 week's prompts, choose the one that resonated with you most. Pick two other students in class and read their options and their choices. In this week's essay, summarize each of those responses with a simple bullet list in your own file and then pretend THEIR CHOICES are the only choices you have (don't go back and revisit your essay for the prompt). Given their choices only, which would YOU choose? Do you agree with the authors? Explain why or why not.

> I am choosing week 4’s prompt because it was one that I was not very certain what to do in general and I am curious about other people’s responses to such a challenge.

Week #4: While working on a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three responses? What do you do?

## Summary 1:

### Response 1: Tough Love

Okay, so in this scenario, the manager's like, "Hey, we've got a job to do, so suck it up and get it done."

Pros:
- Keeps the project moving forward.
- Shows dedication to the project and customer.

Cons:
- Doesn't address the team member's mental health needs.
- Could lead to lower-quality work and morale issues.
- It may come off as insensitive.

#### The manager's basically saying, "I get it's tough, but let's power through it." They're quoting some biblical verses about different seasons of life, which kind of suggests that sometimes you just gotta push through the rough patches. But, like, it's a bit harsh considering the circumstances.

### Response 2: Taking a Break

Here, the manager's like, "Hey, your well-being comes first. Take some paid time off to get better."

Pros:
- Prioritizes the team member's mental health.
- Shows empathy and understanding.

Cons:
- Could burden other team members.
- May cause delays and extra costs for the company.
- It's like investing resources without immediate returns.

#### This response is more about compassion. The manager's quoting the Golden Rule, you know, treating others as you'd want to be treated. It's a solid move to put the team member's needs first, but it might mess with the project's flow and the team's workload.

### Response 3: Balancing Act

So, in this one, the manager's trying to do a bit of everything—offer resources, maybe some time off, while still keeping the project in motion.

Pros:
- Provides support resources while keeping the project going.
- Shows a mix of empathy and pragmatism.

Cons:
- Uses up company resources.
- Could still cause some project hiccups.
- It may not fly with company policies or resources.

#### The manager's being like, "We'll hook you up with resources, and if you need a breather, just ask." It's all about that biblical principle of helping the weak, but also keeping things moving. It's a good compromise, but it's not perfect since it could still hit some bumps along the way.

### Conclusion:
Overall, it's a tough call, but I'd lean towards Response 3. You wanna support your team member, but you also gotta keep the project on track. Plus, it's just the right thing to do, you know, showing compassion while still getting stuff done.

## Summary 2: 

### Response 1: Support and Confidentiality

Okay, Evan's first move is all about creating a supportive vibe and keeping things hush-hush.

Pros:
- Builds a supportive atmosphere, showing empathy.
- Respecting the teammate's privacy builds trust.
- It's just plain decent, you know, looking out for each other.

Cons:
- Could take the focus off project deadlines.
- Might get the company in hot water legally.
- Juggling support and project needs ain't easy.

#### In the script, Evan's like, "Your well-being is top priority, let's figure out how to handle your workload." He's pulling a quote from Galatians about sharing burdens, which fits the situation. But it's a tightrope act between being a good colleague and getting the job done.

### Response 2: Inform Management with Consent

Now, Evan's thinking it might be best to loop in the higher-ups but only with the teammate's OK.

Pros:
- Keeps things professional and transparent.
- Management might have extra resources to help out.
- Helps management understand the situation for potential adjustments.

Cons:
- Could breach trust and confidentiality if the teammate ain't cool with it.
- There's a risk of stigma or discrimination if the word gets out.
- Management might prioritize the project over the teammate's well-being.

#### In Evan's talk, he's like, "Let's chat with management, but only if you're cool with it." He's tossing in a biblical verse from Thessalonians about lifting each other up, which feels right. It's all about balancing honesty with respecting the teammate's wishes.

### Response 3: Advocate for Project Support and Flexibility

Here, Evan's thinking about finding a middle ground, where both the project and the teammate's mental health get some love.

Pros:
- Suggests tweaks to the project to help out.
- Builds team spirit by tackling issues together.
- Shows Evan's thinking about the big picture, not just deadlines.

Cons:
- Management might not be down with changing things up.
- There's no guarantee it'll fix everything for the teammate or the project.
- It could take time to sort out, which might stress everyone out more.

#### Evan's pitching in with, "Let's see if we can adjust things to make it work for everyone." He's quoting Philippians about looking out for each other, which fits the vibe. It's about finding a win-win, but it ain't gonna be easy.

### Conclusion:
If I'm Evan, I'm leaning toward Response 2. It's about being honest while respecting the teammate's privacy. But hey, each response has its ups and downs—it's all about finding the right balance between supporting your team and getting the job done.

## Final Conclusion
>The responses from both summaries highlight how hard this decision is considering the project demands with team members' mental health needs. Each response offers a solid variety of approaches, emphasizing priorities such as project success, empathy, confidentiality, and transparency. Ultimately, the decision depends on the specific context, company culture, and the individual needs of the team member. I personally think the Lord and universally held ideas uphold the first summaries 2nd option best.


## My Final-Final Choice
>Considering the options presented by both summaries, I would lean towards Response 2 from Summary 1. That is because the response prioritizes the team member's mental health while still recognizing the importance of transparency and honesty with management. By seeking consent before informing higher-ups, it respects the teammate's privacy while also potentially accessing additional resources to support them.
