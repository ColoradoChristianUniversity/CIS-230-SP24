Week 5 Ethics Response
=
### **Question:**
You are a Computer Science professor at a local university teaching C Sharp to some very smart business students. In the second week of class, you spend an entire lecture with your students exhaustively talking about software plagiarism and copyright law with a Christian intellectual property attorney who makes it truly clear that taking code from another developer or site then calling it your own is not only legally wrong but morally wrong. In addition, your institution publishes the following policy:

>Plagiarism includes using someone else's data file as your own or representing the work of others as your own.

>The penalty for violating the academic integrity code is severe. Any student violating the academic integrity code may receive a failing grade for the course and will be reported. If a student is unclear about whether a particular situation may constitute an academic integrity violation, the student should meet with the instructor to discuss the situation.

>For this class, it is permissible to assist classmates in general discussions and such general advice and interaction is encouraged. Each person, however, must develop his or her own solutions to the assigned projects, assignments, and tasks. In other words, students may not "work together" on graded assignments unless specifically assigned to a group task by the course instructor. Such unauthorized collaboration would constitute cheating. A student may not use or copy (by any means) another's work (or portions of it) and represent it as his or her own.

**Then this happens:**
Just a week or two into class, one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. Too good? You check and discover the code is identical to a C# tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. The writing is on the wall. But remember, you love this student: you don't want to overreact. But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: you don't want to underreact. A lot to think about. What do you do?

---
### 1) Uphold the integrity of academic standards and the institution's policy.
---
### Pros
1) Maintains consistency and fairness in academic evaluations.
2) Sends a clear message about the seriousness of plagiarism.
3) Upholds the reputation and credibility of the institution.

### Cons
1) May result in severe consequences for the student, potentially impacting their academic record.
2) Could strain the relationship between the professor and the student.
3) Might create a sense of distrust among students towards the professor.

### Scripture
>“Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.” - Colossians 3:23-24
## Script
**Me:** "I've found that your code is identical to a tutorial online, which violates our policy on plagiarism."

**Student:** "I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was wrong."

**Me:** "Copying code without attribution is not allowed. This violates our academic integrity code."
### Principle: Adhering to established academic standards and policies promotes fairness and integrity within the educational system.
---
### 2) Give the student a chance to redo the assignment.
---
### Pros
1) Allows the student to rectify their mistake and learn from it.
2) Demonstrates compassion and a commitment to the student's academic growth.
3) Encourages honesty and accountability.

### Cons
1) May be perceived as leniency by other students.
2) Could set a precedent for similar incidents in the future.
3) Might not fully address the seriousness of the plagiarism.

### Scripture
>“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” – 1 John 1:9
## Script
**Me:** "I understand you may have struggled, but copying isn't the solution. I'll give you a chance to redo it."

**Student:** "Thank you, I'll make sure to do it myself this time."

**Me:** "I appreciate your understanding. Remember, it's important to learn from our mistakes."
### Principle: Offering an opportunity for redemption aligns with the principle of second chances and fosters a supportive learning environment.
---
### 3) Ask the student to explain the code, and if they can, grade it as normal.
---
### Pros
1) Provides an opportunity for the student to demonstrate understanding and mastery of the material.
2) Allows the professor to assess the student's comprehension and critical thinking skills.
3) Offers a middle ground between strict enforcement and leniency.

### Cons
1) Relies on subjective judgment by the professor, which could be challenged.
2) May not fully address the issue of plagiarism if the student can explain the code but still copied it.
3) Could be seen as inconsistent with the institution's policy on academic integrity.

### Scripture
>“For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare[a] and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.” - Jeremiah 29:11
## Script
**Me:** "Before I proceed with grading, can you explain the code you submitted in your own words?"

**Student:** "Sure, let me walk you through it."

**Me:** "Thank you for explaining. Based on your understanding and explanation, I'll grade the assignment as normal."
### Principle: Promotes the importance of understanding and mastery of the material while still addressing the issue of plagiarism.

### **Conclusion**
In conclusion, the process of addressing academic integrity requires careful consideration of available options. Each approach brings its own merits and drawbacks. Decisions should prioritize fairness, accountability, and integrity promotion. Drawing from biblical principles like accountability and discernment can guide this process, fostering an environment where students develop both knowledge and ethical responsibility. This approach aims to equip students for academic success and ethical decision-making in their future endeavors.

### **My Final Choice**

In my final choice, I opt to ask the student to explain the code and, if they can, grade it as normal. This approach allows for a balanced assessment of the situation, considering both the academic integrity violation and the student's understanding of the material. By allowing the student to demonstrate comprehension, I uphold accountability while also promoting a supportive learning environment. This decision aligns with biblical principles of discernment and the value of understanding, guiding students toward academic growth and ethical responsibility.
