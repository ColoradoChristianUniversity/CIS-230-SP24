# Week 15 Ethics Response
## Question:
You are a software engineer working for a marketing firm that has been hired by a tobacco company to analyze data for a new product. Your team is excited to work on this project because it could save your struggling company during a bad economy. However, you suspect the customer is intending the product for young audiences, but you are not sure. To make matters worse, you have been trying to build a relationship with a coworker who has criticized religion as judgmental; you are worried that taking a moral stand against this product could come across as hypocritical and cause you to lose the opportunity to reach him just as he is softening to spiritual conversations. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


## **Answer**
## Option 1: First confirm that the business will be targeting young people, then argue for the company to not pursue this job.


| Pros  | Cons |
| :---: | :---: |
| This upholds moral integrity by refusing to contribute to potentially harmful targeting of young people. | This would mean losing the project and potential financial stability for the company. |
| It demonstrates courage in standing up for what is right. | This would strain my relationship with the company. |
| This would align with personal values and principles, fostering a clear conscience. | it is a missed opportunity to influence positive change from within the company. |


### Scripture:
> "So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God." - 1 Corinthians 10:31


## **Script:**
**Me:** "I believe as a company, we should uphold ethical standards and avoid contributing to the harm of young people."


**Boss:** "But this project could be a lifeline for us."


**Me:** "I understand the financial implications, but its simply the wrong thing to do if they will be targeting a vulnerable demographic with addictive substances."




## Principle: It is essential as a representative of God to be prudent in these type of situations. God uses us to effect change and saying no to this job might be rejecting an opportunity to change the tobacco business.




## Option 2: Do the project and discuss the implications with the coworker.


| Pros  | Cons |
| :---: | :---: |
| This maintains the opportunity to address concerns with the coworker and potentially influence their perspective. | It compromises personal values by participating in a project that may harm young people. |
| This allows for completion of the project while creating an opportunity for open dialogue. | This would be a lazy way to resolve the issue. |
| It avoids immediate conflict with the boss and potential negative effects for the company. | Coworker might think this is also a flaw in religion because I am so okay doing this project. |


### Scripture:
> "Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing." - 1 Thessalonians 5:11


## **Script:**
**Me:** "Hey, I wanted to talk to you about something."


**Co-Worker:** "Oh, really? What's on your mind?"


**Me:** "I'm uncomfortable with the idea of contributing to something that might harm young people. It's been bothering me. But I believe it’ll still be good for the business. Do you think this is right?"


## Principle: Doing jobs for people that are in active sin allows people to affect them positively, not simply rejecting interaction with them.




## Option 3: Present the idea of it not just being the wrong thing to do from a religious view, but as generally unacceptable to target young people with an addictive substance.


| Pros  | Cons |
| :---: | :---: |
| This frames the issue in a universally acceptable manner, appealing to something other than religious beliefs. | It risks the boss and team members not caring about the issue enough to do anything |
| it positions the objection as a matter of societal responsibility rather than personal conviction, hopefully being more easily accepted. | They might dismiss it as overly idealistic in the context of business objectives. |
| This allows for a principled stance against targeting vulnerable demographics without alienating coworkers. | It is a missed opportunity to address the moral implications more directly and assertively. |


### Scripture:
> "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect." - Romans 12:2


## **Script:**
**Me:** "I've been thinking about our collaboration with the tobacco company, and I'm concerned about the potential impact on young people. Targeting them with addictive substances just doesn't sit right with me."


**Boss:** "I understand your concerns, but we need to consider the business aspect of this project."


**Me:** "I agree, but I believe as a responsible company, we should prioritize the well-being of our society, especially vulnerable demographics like young people.”


## Principle: Advocating for ethical behavior is a great way to start the conversation about right and wrong. It is a good way to be conscious of others' biased nature toward religion, and hopefully steer them towards God.


## **Excursus**
In a situation like this, each step needs balance between personal values and professional responsibilities. Whether I choose to take a principled stand, initiate dialogue, or reframe the conversation, the key is staying true to my moral compass while fostering understanding and collaboration. In the end, it's not just about the destination, but the journey of integrity and growth in every decision we make. We should be prudent in all situations when it comes to business, and God wants us to be involved with those who seek to do harm to others in hopes of changing their hearts.


## **My Final Choice**
I have decided to opt for Option 3. I will articulate my concerns regarding the targeting of addictive substances towards young individuals. I will seek to present these apprehensions in a manner that doesn’t involve anyone's religious views. By framing the discourse around societal responsibility rather than solely relying on religious convictions, I hope to initiate constructive dialogue and potentially influence a more conscientious approach to the project. It is imperative to maintain integrity while fostering a conducive atmosphere for understanding and collaboration. I can be a positive affect in all situations, and this is a challenge God has given me to take head on.
