# Week 11 Ethics Response
## Question:
While working for the government, you are asked to solve a seemingly impossible problem in 2 months. You find a third-party software that can do it, but procurement takes 6 months at a minimum. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


## **Answer**
## Option 1: Ask for government assistance to solve the problem instead of the 3rd party


| Pros  | Cons |
| :---: | :---: |
| Uses existing resources and expertise within the government.  |Government resources may be stretched thin.|
| Might lead to a more tailored and cost-effective solution. | Like most Government Solutions, the processes may be slow and waste more time.|
| Shows that I am interested being transparent and honest | It shows that I cannot do creative problem solving at a high level without help.|


### Scripture:
>"Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others." - Philippians 2:3-4


## **Script:**
**Me:** "Since the 3rd party procurement will take too long, why don't we use government resources to tackle this?"


**Boss:** "Good idea. Let's see if anyone at a high level can help."


**Me:** "I'll reach out and see what we can find."


## Principle:
The thing to try to maintain throughout a process like this would be responsibility for acquiring assistance, and a willingness to see the problem through without jumping ship.


## Option 2: Try to find another resource and if that is not possible then show my due diligence to my boss requesting that they move forwards with the 6-month procurement.


| Pros  | Cons |
| :---: | :---: |
|This shows my initiative and a proactive approach.|Finding a totally new software may be impossible as well.|
|Shows that I understand that there are steps one needs to take before resorting to a less than ideal solution. |There is no guarantee that the solution you found will be approved.|
|Provides a backup plan if no alternative resources are found.|Requesting an exception may not go over well.|


### Scripture:
>"Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and he will establish your plans." - Proverbs 16:3


## **Script:**
**Me:** "I couldn't find another option, so let's go with the 6-month procurement."


**Management:** "Are you sure?"


**Me:** "Yes, I've looked for better options and this seems like the best choice."


## Principle:
This type of solution comes at the cost of proving that I have done good research, but shows at the end of the day that I am committed to overcoming uncertain challenges.


## Option 3: Pass this problem off to a more capable person, explaining that it is something that you are unable to do without a more flexible timeframe.
| Pros  | Cons |
| :---: | :---: |
|Lets someone more capable handle it, possibly ending in a better result. | This might look like avoiding responsibility.|
|Acknowledges limitations and focuses on efficiency.|The person receiving the problem may not have the skills or resources.|
|Shows humility and a willingness to prioritize the project over personal involvement.| The risk is also that they say you have to solve this without help anyways.|


### Scripture:
>"We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your[a] faith; 7 if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach; 8 if it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead,[b] do it diligently; if it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully." - Romans 12:6-8


## **Script:**
**Me:** "I think someone else might be better suited for this task."


**Management:** "Who do you have in mind?"


**Me:** "I have made a small list of people I know that might be better suited to this problem. Here you go…"


## Principle:
The best employee is one that recognizes his weaknesses and seeks to find the most effective solution. This option might not make me feel cool, but looking cool isn’t everything.


## **Excursus**
Thinking about this situation a bit more, the government really needs a solution fast. The third-party software seems like a perfect fit, but the procurement process is a huge roadblock. It will take at least six months just to get the software, which is a long time for a problem that needs fixing ASAP. Meeting deadlines is the real challenge here. I can’t see a perfect solution no matter what option I choose, but I believe I went with the best of the batch.

## **My Final Choice**
I'd go with Option 2: I'd try to find another resource, and if that's not possible, I'd show my boss that I've done my homework and suggest we go ahead with the 6-month procurement. It shows I'm being proactive and responsible, looking for the best solution even if it takes a bit longer. Plus, it's important to follow the rules and processes, even if they can be a bit slow sometimes. This option shows that I did my due diligence and that I care about meeting the government's expectations the best I can.
