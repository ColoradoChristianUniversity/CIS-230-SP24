# Week 1 Ethics Response
### Question:
While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employer’s second-largest customer: a well-known pornography website. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

### 1) Refuse to take the job and lose the client.
### Pros
- Upholds personal ethical comfort and values.
- Avoids potential conflicts of interest.
### Cons
- Loss of a significant client and potential revenue.
- May lead to strained relationships with the employer.
### Scripture
"One person considers one day more sacred than another; another considers every day alike. Each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind." - Romans 14:5
### Script
- Me: "I appreciate the opportunity, but I cannot do this job in good conscience, I'd prefer that we not take this job.”
- Boss: "Understood. I think we can weather losing their business but it may mean less opportunities for you in the future."
- Me: “I can accept that.”
### Principle: 
It is important to stick to your beliefs when you are confident in them, however, do not let those beliefs blind you so that you are a closed book.


### 2) request that someone else handle this particular job instead of you.
### Pros
- Delegates the task while maintaining a professional approach.
- Allows the issue to be addressed without personal involvement.
### Cons
- Potential for miscommunication or lack of control.
- Requires effective communication with the assigned team member.
### Scripture
“So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.” – 1 Corinthians 10:31
### Script
- Me: "I'm committed to the team's success. However, I'd like to request another team member to handle this task due to personal reasons."
- Boss: "Sure, let's identify someone and ensure a smooth resolution."
### Principle: 
Passing the job to the next guy shows that you have a code of loyalty to the success of the company, however, it may also show that you just don’t want to get your hands dirty.

### 3) Do the job.
### Pros
- Demonstrates commitment to professional responsibilities.
- Retains the client and contributes to their efficiency and profitability.
### Cons
- Personal discomfort with the nature of the client's business.
- Potential ethical concerns depending on individual beliefs.
### Scripture
"Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the realm of the dead, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.” - Ecclesiastes 9:10
### Script
- Me: "I'm committed to resolving the client's issues, focusing on the technical aspects and compliance."
Boss: "Great. Keep me updated on the progress."
### Principle: 
At the end of the day, this is the job that you took, and doing the job is something that could lead to sharing your faith with the porn company.

### 4) Demand to be paid for the burden this has on you.
### Pros
- Addresses the additional burden placed on the engineer.
- Acknowledges the potential impact on personal well-being.
### Cons
- May strain the relationship with the business.
- Could be perceived as unprofessional or inappropriate.
### Scripture
“For Scripture says, ‘Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,’[a] and ‘The worker deserves his wages.’” - 1 Timothy 5:18
### Script
- Me: "I'm willing to take on the task, but given the nature, I'd like to discuss additional compensation for the extra burden."
- Boss: "Let's talk about compensation. We value your contribution.”
### Principle: 
If you are going to do something that causes discomfort, you are potentially deserving of a bonus.

#### Conclusion
In navigating the ethical dilemma, each option presents its own set of considerations and trade-offs. The decision-making process involves a delicate balance between personal values, professional responsibilities, and the impact on stakeholders. Individuals should be fully convinced in their own minds and strive to act with integrity and wisdom in challenging situations. While maintaining one's beliefs is important, it is equally crucial not to close oneself off to alternative perspectives.

#### My Final Choice
Considering the options, I would lean towards Option 2 - Request that someone else handle this particular job instead of me. This choice aligns with the principle of doing all things for the glory of God (1 Corinthians 10:31). By delegating the task to a team member, I aim to maintain a professional approach and address the client's issues while navigating personal reservations. This decision reflects a commitment to the success of the team and the company, acknowledging the importance of loyalty while recognizing the complexity of the task at hand.
