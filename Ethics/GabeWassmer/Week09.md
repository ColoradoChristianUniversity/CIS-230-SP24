# Week 9 Ethics Response
## Question:
While writing some code Saturday night, you realize you have introduced a crippling bug that breaks the entire system. As a Christian, you have politely requested no deadlines, meetings, or work ever occur on Sunday. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## **Answer**
## Option 1: Do the work on Sunday.

| Pros  | Cons |
| :---: | :---: |
| Resolves the issue promptly, minimizing downtime.  |Doesn't actually contradict Christian ideals, but might contradict your own.|
| Shows responsibility and dedication.  |This choice could set a precedent for future work on Sundays.|
| Upholds the team's trust in your commitment to the success of the system. | This would make me uncomfortable, as it goes against my valued practice.|

### Scripture:
>"And he said to them, 'Which of you, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day, will not immediately pull him out?'" - Luke 14:5

## **Script:**
**Me:** "I will fix this issue, but I will not make it a habit."

**Management:** "Thank you for your sacrifice. We will do our best to help you find an alternative if something like this happens again."

**Me:** "Thank you."

## Principle:
The most important thing to remember when breaking a good practice is that the threshold for breaking it cannot be lowered without careful consideration.

## Option 2: Report the issue to the business and request that they solve the issue.

| Pros  | Cons |
| :---: | :---: |
|Honors personal practices while addressing the problem.|This might result in extended downtime before the issue is resolved.|
|Shows that you hold your ground.|It also might strain relationships with management or colleagues if perceived as avoiding responsibility.|
|Pushes the team to solve this problem creatively.|May not align with a sense of personal accountability.|

### Scripture:
>"Keep putting into practice all you learned and received from me—everything you heard from me and saw me doing. Then the God of peace will be with you." - Philippians 4:9-11

## **Script:**
**Me:** "I have made a mistake with the code and cannot resolve it unless I work tomorrow. I would like to request that someone from the team resolves the issue."

**Management:** "We can resolve it. Thank you for notifying us."

**Me:** "Of course."

## Principle:
Requesting that management figure out a way to solve the issue might seem wrong, but sometimes there are things that you need to "die on your sword" for.

## Option 3: Ask to have a coworker assist you on Monday morning to resolve the issue before business hours.
| Pros  | Cons |
| :---: | :---: |
|Allows you to remain consistent with your practices.|Puts a burden on your coworker.|
|Cures the problem with the bug.|Might give the impression that you are not loyal enough in some areas.|
|Shows that you are committed to the safety of the system.|Risks failure due to a narrow time constraint.|

### Scripture:
>"Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ." - Galatians 6:2

## **Script:**
**Me:** "Hey, I made a mistake with the code. I would like to fix it, but it goes against my ideals to work on Sunday. Can I work Monday morning with my coworker to fix it?"

**Management:** "Yes, that will be okay."

**Me:** "Thank you very much. I will update you as soon as it’s fixed on Monday."

## Principle:
Finding creative ways to problem solve is something that one must practice to stay true to their principles.

## **Excursus**
While each option presents compromise, the final decision should align with personal values, uphold professional integrity, and promote a healthy work-life balance. By navigating these challenges through research of what Jesus might do, and thinking about the threshold of things that I might sacrifice my practices, I have come to a final decision. I believe that the most important thing to remember with this dilemma is that Jesus himself mentions that there are reasons to do work on Sunday.

## **My Final Choice**
For my final choice, I chose to do the work on Sunday despite my Christian practice. I believe that this is a choice that is similar to what Jesus mentioned when he asked the question of who out of the Pharisees would help their son or ox out of a well. This decision shows that as an employee, you have dedication to meeting professional obligations and ensuring efficient operations of the project, even at the expense of feeling uncomfortable.
