## You are a software engineer working for a marketing firm that has been hired by a tobacco company to analyze data for a new product. Your team is excited to work on this project because it could save your struggling company during a bad economy. However, you suspect the customer is intending the product for young audiences, but you are not sure. To make matters worse, you have been trying to build a relationship with a coworker who has criticized religion as judgmental; you are worried that taking a moral stand against this product could come across as hypocritical and cause you to lose the opportunity to reach him just as he is softening to spiritual conversations. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Option 1: Talk to the Pastor Directly

**Pros:**
- Keeps things honest and open.
- Gives the pastor a chance to explain.
- Could lead to positive changes.

**Cons:**
- Might strain your relationship with the pastor.
- Could cause tension in the church.
- There might be unintended consequences.

**Conversation:**
You: Hey Pastor, I noticed something odd while going through the giving records.
Pastor: Oh? What did you find?
You: Your name doesn't appear on the list. Is there a reason for that?
Pastor: Well, I've been going through some financial difficulties...
You: I understand, Pastor. I just think it's important for our community to be transparent about these things.

**Bible Verse:** "Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed." - James 5:16 (ESV)

## Option 2: Discuss with Church Leadership

**Pros:**
- Shares the responsibility with others.
- Gets input from different perspectives.
- Prevents personal biases from influencing decisions.

**Cons:**
- Gossip might spread.
- Might not solve the issue right away.
- Could damage trust if not handled carefully.

**Conversation:**
You: I found something concerning in the church records.
Elder: What's up?
You: It seems the Pastor hasn't made any contributions.
Elder: That's troubling. Let's talk to the rest of the leadership team before deciding what to do.

**Bible Verse:** "Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety." - Proverbs 11:14 (ESV)

## Option 3: Reflect and Pray First

**Pros:**
- Gives time for personal reflection.
- Approach the situation with grace.
- Avoids making impulsive decisions.

**Cons:**
- Might delay dealing with the issue.
- Could lead to frustration.
- Misses opportunities for resolution.

**Reflection:**
You: (In prayer) Lord, I need your guidance on this situation. Please give me the wisdom to handle it well.

**Bible Verse:** "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths." - Proverbs 3:5-6 (ESV)

# Final Decision

## Option 2: Discuss with Church Leadership

**Pros:**
- Shares the responsibility with trusted individuals.
- Gets input from different perspectives.
- Prevents personal biases from influencing decisions.

**Cons:**
- Gossip might spread.
- Might not solve the issue right away.
- Could damage trust if not handled carefully.

**Expected Outcome:** The leadership team may decide on a course of action, which could involve confronting the pastor or offering support and guidance without causing embarrassment or conflict.

**Personal Choice:** I'd go with Option 2. It's important to involve others and get their input, especially in delicate situations like this. Plus, having a collective decision minimizes the risk of personal biases affecting the outcome. And seeking wisdom from multiple perspectives aligns well with biblical principles.
