# While volunteering to help with computers at your church, you are given access to giving records. Because of your work, you unexpectedly discover your senior pastor does not give anything to your church. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

Pastor: (Taken aback) Well, you see, I've been facing some financial difficulties lately...
You: I understand, Pastor. I just wanted to bring it up because transparency is crucial in our community, and I believe addressing this openly could strengthen our bond.
