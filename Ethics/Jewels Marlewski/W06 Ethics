**Decision:**

- **Explanation:**
  - While understanding the situation and the student's perspective is valuable, it's important to uphold academic integrity.
  - Offering a second chance without providing credit for the initial attempt demonstrates empathy while still holding the student accountable for their actions.

**Agreement with Micah:**
I agree with Micahs' choice. Providing a second chance with clear consequences for plagiarism strikes a balance between empathy and upholding academic standards, especially considering the early stage of the course. This approach acknowledges the seriousness of plagiarism while also recognizing the potential for growth and improvement in the student's academic journey.
