# Handling a Difficult Situation in an Engineering Team

## Situation:
You've been mentoring a teammate for 6 months without seeing improvement, and he is up for a raise with sole credit for your joint work.

### Possible Responses:

### Response 1: Direct Communication

#### Script:
You: "Hey [Teammate's Name], can we talk?"
Teammate: "Sure, what's up?"
You: "I've noticed some challenges in our collaboration, and I think it's important we address them. Despite our efforts, I haven't seen the progress we hoped for in your role. Additionally, I've become aware that you're being considered for a raise based on work we've done together, but I believe credit should be shared. I want to discuss how we can move forward in a way that's fair to both of us."

#### First Principle:
Act with integrity and fairness, treating others as you would want to be treated (Matthew 7:12).

You: "I think we're facing some challenges that might benefit from a mediator's perspective. Would you be open to involving a neutral third party to help us navigate this situation?"
Teammate: "I'm not sure..."
You: "I understand it might seem unconventional, but I believe it could help us find a fair resolution and preserve our working relationship."

#### First Principle:
Seek wisdom and guidance when facing difficult decisions (Proverbs 3:5-6).

#### Script:
You: "I've become aware that you're being considered for a raise based on work we've done together. However, I believe that credit should be shared appropriately, considering our joint efforts. I'm going to address this with our leadership to ensure proper recognition of our collaboration."

### First Principle:
Stand firm in truth and righteousness, advocating for fairness and justice (Micah 6:8).

### Outcome:

My personal choice would be Response 1: Direct Communication. This approach aligns with my values of honesty, transparency, and fairness. It offers an opportunity for open dialogue and mutual understanding, with the potential for a resolution that respects both parties' contributions.

### Warning:
Approach the situation with empathy and understanding, considering the potential impact on your teammate's morale and self-esteem.
