>  <h1>üìùPrompt:</h1> While working for the government, you are asked to solve a seemingly impossible problem in 2 months. You find a third-party software that can do it, but procurement takes 6 months at a minimum. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

üü¢ <font color="lightgreen">Pros</font> | üî¥ <font color="red">Cons</font> |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Potentially more time | Dishonesty |
| Less stress and problem solved | Government may not approve of software | 

</center>

<font color="Cyan">___Dialogue___</font>

> One response to this problem would be to appeal to your own superiors in the government, and to ask for an extension on the task. You do not have to let them know about the third party program necessarily, but simply that you need more time. In doing so, you may be able to gain more time for the project without having to face potential complications in using  3rd party software. However, this requires some degree of dishonesty.

> Paul writes,
> > "And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance of hope until the end, so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises" (Heb 6:11-12, ESV).
>
> In this passage, Paul write about the importance of diligence and working hard, specifically in the faith. However, one may interpret this verse as to work hard in everything one does, and in using the 3rd party software, this may be the best way to go about ones work.

<h2> ‚úçÔ∏è <font color="Cyan">Response 2</font></h2>

<center>

üü¢ <font color="lightgreen">Pros</font> | üî¥ <font color="red">Cons</font> |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Higher respect gained | Risk of failure higher |
| Integrity maintained |  | 

</center>

<font color="Cyan">___Dialogue___</font>

> Anorther response to this problem would be to commit to figuring out the problem within 2 months. While the problem may seem impossible, commiting to the task would ensure integrity, and would also result in higher respect from your peers/superiors. However, the risk of failure is higher.

<font color="Cyan">___Scripture___</font>

> As far as integrity goes, the Proverbs say,
> > "Whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but he who makes his ways crooked will be found out" (Prov 10:9, ESV).
>
> With this verse in mind, committing to the original task time frame retains integrity and would be the most moral way to go about the delimma, regardless of the risk.

<h2> ‚úçÔ∏è <font color="Cyan">Response 3</font></h2>

<center>

üü¢ <font color="lightgreen">Pros</font> | üî¥ <font color="red">Cons</font> |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Appeal for more time | Potential lost faith from superiors |
| Integrity maintained | 3rd party software brought to spotlight | 

</center>

<font color="Cyan">___Dialogue___</font>

> A final response to this delimma would be to inform the government of the third party software and ask for the 6 months. Doing so would probably result in lost confidence or faith from your superiors, but if it is the only realistic option, then it would be wise and moral to do so. If the task is impossible to accomplish within the itme frame, then nothing can be done to change that. Besides, if you happen to get the task done earlier than 6 months, then that is great.

> The theme of integrity once again returns,
> > "The Lord judges the peoples; judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness and according to the integrity that is in me" (Prov 7:8).
>
> This response again preserves integirty through honesty to superiors, and also explains the hardship of the situation, which is a worthwhile subject regarding the project.

<h2> üß† <font color="Cyan">My Personal Choice</font></h2>

> My personal choice would be the 3rd response. This seems to retain the most honesty but also does not ignore the problem of the difficult project and time frame. While there is some risk, there is also risk in the other options, so this may as well be the best one. Integrity is important.
