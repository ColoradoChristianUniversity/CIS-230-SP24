<font color="Orange"><h1># Week 12 Ethics</h1></font>

>  <h1>üìùPrompt:</h1> While working your dream job for a major engineering firm, you get an email from HR: immediately put your "preferred pronouns" in your email signature and show up this Thursday with a üåà rainbow pin to help celebrate diversity and inclusion. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

<h2> ‚úçÔ∏è <font color="Orange">Response 1</font></h2>

<center>

üü¢ <font color="lightgreen">Pros</font> | üî¥ <font color="red">Cons</font> |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Standing up for what your beleive | Job put at risk |
| Encouraging others to stand up for themselves | LGBT coworkers/customers possibly offended | 

</center>

<font color="Orange">___Dialogue___</font>

> One response to this situation would be to flat-out refuse to participate, and to disobey what your superiors have asked of you. Many would say that in displaying pronouns and wearing a rainbow pin you are advocating for that message/idealology. In doing so, you would be refusing to advocate something that you believe to be sinful or wrong. You would also possibly encourage others not to be pressured into participating in something they don't necessarily beleive in. However, you may risk your job and you also may offend LGBT coworkers.

<font color="Orange">___Scripture___</font>

> Paul writes concerning conformity,
> > "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect" (Rom 12:2 ESV).
>
> This passage can be applied to the situation at work. While it certianly would be popular and easier to conform and wear the pin as well as displaying pronouns, this does signal a moral/ideaogical opinion. If this ideaology/opinion truly is sinful, then one surely should not display/adhere to it.

<h2> ‚úçÔ∏è <font color="Orange">Response 2</font></h2>

<center>

üü¢ <font color="lightgreen">Pros</font> | üî¥ <font color="red">Cons</font> |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Respect coworkers/customers | Most would believe that you support LGBT ideaology |
| Job preserved | Job now influenceing your own beliefs | 

</center>

<font color="Orange">___Dialogue___</font>

> Another approach to this dilemma would be conformity. You can choose to obey your HR and wear the pride pin, as well as displaying your pronouns in email. In doing so, you would be respectful of your coworkers, customers, and their beliefs. This will preserve your reputation and job, as you will be obeying their authority. However, in doing so, most would assume that you support and believe in the ideaology behind what you are presenting. Also, you would be participating in letting a higher authority influence what you believe and how you present your own beliefs.

<font color="Orange">___Scripture___</font>

> Later, Paul emphasizes the importance of obeying your own authorities. He writes,
> > "Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God" (Rom 13:1 ESV).
>
> This verse clearly indicates that one should obey their governing authorities which, in this case, is HR. So, you should clearly wear the pin and display your pronouns. But what if you are advocating for sin in doing so? Does this verse still apply?

<h2> ‚úçÔ∏è <font color="Orange">Response 3</font></h2>

<center>

üü¢ <font color="lightgreen">Pros</font> | üî¥ <font color="red">Cons</font> |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Display appreciation/kindness still | Many may still be angered |
| Suspect adgenda/ideaology not adhered to | Job remains at risk. | 

</center>

<font color="Orange">___Dialogue___</font>

> A final response to this issue would be to find a middle ground and negotiate. You could refuse to participate in the flag-wearing but still display your pronouns, as they indicate less of an adgenda. Instead of wearing a pride pin to support inclusion, you can personally thank your coworkers for their work and support them face-to-face. This would dodge an adgenda/ideaology but remain respsectful of your coworkers or customers. Your actions can determine your kindness towards others. However, many may still be angered regardless and your job may still be put at risk. It is worth a shot though.

<font color="Orange">___Scripture___</font>

> Paul writes to the Colossians, saying,
> > "Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience" (Col 3:12 ESV). 
>
> The virtues which this verse advocates are what one should display. They are more valuable and heart-telling than wearing a flag pin. In displaying these qualities, you can be respectful of others as Paul writes.

<h2> üß† <font color="Orange">My Personal Choice</font></h2>

> My personal choice of responses for this assignment would response 3. This seems like the safest and kindest bet of the three. I am writing from a CHristian perspective, and so, I view knowingly adhereing to the ideology which the flag represents as bad and possibly sinful. So, the only way to be kind while also standing up for yourself would be response 3 or something similar.
