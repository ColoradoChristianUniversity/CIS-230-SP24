<h2>My Response</h2>
My choice between these two responses would be Seth's option 2. Though Diego's response is very appealing and also a totally valid option, I believe to resolve the issue of the trafficking scheme as quickly as possible, Seth's response must be chosen. I am assuming that the authorities cannot afford to take their sweet old time with this operation, and in my opinion, the swift, harsher option will be the most effective and quickest way to stop the scheme. Besides, some level of trust is still maintained with the users of the open-source project, as it still is updated in the terms and conditions.
