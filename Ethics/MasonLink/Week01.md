# Week 01 Ethics

Prompt: While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employerâ€™s second largest customer: a well-known pornography web site. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

<h2>Response 1</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- You are guarenteed to not aid or associate with a sinful practice (a pornography website). 
- You may have peace of mind regarding the morals of the situation. 

<h4>Cons</h4>

- You would most likley be fired, and would lose you salary to support yourself and maybe even your family.
- Strife in the workplace, closing the door to negotiations for the future or open communication. 

<h4>Dialog</h4>

<p> This first response would be to refuse to do your employer's wishes of repairing the website and quit your job or be fired. This is a very firm and stubborn response, but it guarentees moral closure and clarity. By refusing and most likley being fired, you do not risk sinning (by possibly supporting the pornographic website), and you may sleep better at night. However, this would also result in possible hardship towards yourself and/or your family finanacially. This descision would also cause stife and hardship in the workplace. </p>

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>

<p> "If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell" (Matt 5:29, ESV). This verse sheds light on that fact that we must avoid sinning at all costs, even if we must figuratively cut out our right eye if it sins. Thus, it is better to refuse to work than to risk sin, in light of this verse, which stresses the severity of sin. </p>

<h2>Response 2</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- You are not responsible for other peoples choices to sin.
- You must take care of your own livelihood.

<h4>Cons</h4>

- You are enabling people to sin.
- Risk of sinning yourself, and opening the door to future work in the same field.

<h4>Dialog</h4>

<p> This second response would be to complete the task of resolving the pornographic website's problems. This would result in the website being more effective and profitable. However, you might say that you are not reponsible for other people's choices to sin. In addition to this, by agreeing to resolve the website's issues, you are not necessarily agreeing with the website's practices; you may simply we working for your next paycheck and for the good of yourself. However, in aiding the website, you are also enabling people to sin, and enabling a website to cause people to sin as well. You yourself are also at risk of sin in working on the pornographic website. Finally, would agreeing to work on this website indicate that you would be open to doing the same tasks in the future?

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>

<p> "And as he reclined at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him" (Mk 2:15, ESV). This verse shows how Jesus ate with sinners and still did not sin while he was among them. In the same way, one may argue that working on a sinful website but not sinning directly is possible, and is permissable. </p>

<h2>Response 3</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- No risk of sin.
- You retain your job!


<h4>Cons</h4>

- Your reputation may be tainted, hurting your career.
- You are simply shifting the sinful task to someone else.

<h4>Dialog</h4>

<p> This final response would be to attempt to convince your employer that you should not do this job, or something of this nature. Possibly avoid the task, or find another person to resolve the issues of the pornographic website instead. If you are not fired, this would save you from risk of sin, and also retain your job and income. This could be a win-win situation. However, there is a still a risk of being fired, or viewed as unreliable or lazy. This may also result in a layoff later down the road. Also, shifting responsibilities is simply allowing someone else to sin instead of you, in a way. </p>

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>

"No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it" (1 Cor 10:13). This verse speaks to God providing an 'out' to temptaion. While this verse may not speak directly to the situation, it shows how God is present in difficult situations regarding sin, such as this, and he will prodive a way to pursue righteousness in the midst of it. This third response may be a way to do just that.

<h2>My Personal Choice</h2>

<p>I would choose to go with response 3. I don't think you should be too stubborn or firey and simply quit your job, nor do I think doing work on a pornographic website is an ok thing to do ever. Thus, I think a cautious, communicative response is necessary. I would decline the task respectfully to my higher-ups, and explain why. If they are unable to accept this, then being fired is the way to go. If they don't fire me, then good for me. However, I suspect most decent people would let me keep my job and would find someone else to work instead.
