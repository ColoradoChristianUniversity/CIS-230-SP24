Prompt: While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

<h2>Response 1</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- You are not responsible for the employees.
- The employees may deserve to be laid off.

<h4>Cons</h4>

- You will be initiating 175 people losing their jobs.
- You may incur anger from the laid off employees.

<h4>Dialog</h4>

<p> One response to this situation would be to continue to finish the project, despite the fact that the 175 employees will be laid off. One could argue that you are not responsible for those employees, and that you are simply doing you job. Also, you do not know the reason why these employees are being laid off, as many of them could potentially be lazy or underworking employees. For example, in late 2022, Twitter laid off over 2000 employees who were apparently not doing anything productive day to day. However, in agreeing to undertake the project, you are knowingly allowing many employees to lose their jobs. In addition to this, you may incur some anger or resentment from said laid off employees.</p>

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>

<p> "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters" (Col 3:23). This verse shows how in your work, you should work with all your heart. The Bible does not commend laziness, and laziness should not be rewarded. Thus, it is permissible to lay off players who are lazy, and one should not feel guilty working on a project which results in this.</p>

<h2>Response 2</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- You are saving employees from losing their jobs.
- You avoid commiting an injustice.

<h4>Cons</h4>

- Many of the employees may deserve to be laid off.
- You may be fired.

<h4>Dialog</h4>

<p> Another response to this situation would be to refuse to work on the project. In refusing to finishing to project, you are saving over 175 employees from losing their jobs. In addition to this, you may not even know why these employees are being laid off. Many of them could be hardworking, reliable employees, after all. You would be avoiding commiting a possible injustice. A downside to this, however, would be the possible innefficiency in the company, as there is a good chance that many of the employees who are planned to be laid off are actually lazy and unneeded in the company. Also, you yourself may be fired as a result of refusing to work on the customer's project.</p>

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>

<p>"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths" (Prov 3:5-6). This verse indicates that rather than relying on the wisdom and understanding of this world, you should do all things while trusting in God's wisdom and plans. In making the desision that is safer morally, in avoiding an injustice, you are trusting in God, and his word.</p>


<h2>Response 3</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- Employees are saved.
- Your job is retained.

<h4>Cons</h4>

- You would be interefering in your customer's business.
- Risk of being fired.

<h4>Dialog</h4>

<p> A final option would be to attempt to conivnce your employeers to not lay off their employees. This would be a riskier option, but it could save some employees from being fired. Using your influence in machine code and consulting, you could potentially convince your customer to lower their standards for lay offs. This would save employees, and it would also allow you to retain your job potentially. However, this would be interfereing in your customer's business, and it would risk you being fired.</p>

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>

<p>"Whoever brings blessing will be enriched, and one who waters will himself be watered" (Prov 11:25). This verse from Proverbs indicated the importance of blessing others. In vouching for the employees who are at risk of being layed off, you are acting in accordance with God's will, and are trying to bless others, as Proverbs says.</p>

<h2>My Personal Choice</h2>

<p> My choice would be to go ahead and work on the project. In my opinion, there is not enough known information on the quality of the employees who are at risk of being laid off, and therefore a judgement cannot be made on the employees. So, I beleive the right thing to do would be to work on the project, as it is not your responsibility or business to interfere with the customer's business.</p>
