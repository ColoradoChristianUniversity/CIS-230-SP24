>  <h1>üìùPrompt:</h1> While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do? <br></br>

<h2>Response 1</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- Rightful reward from work gained.
- Teammate may be encouraged to work harder.

<h4>Cons</h4>

- Animosity with teammate.
- Company leadership may not like this.

<h4>Dialog</h4>

<p>One response to this situation would be to tell the company leadership that your teammate has not put in his adequate work, and that the work was done by yourself. In doing so, you would gain your rightful reward for your work, and it may encourage your teammate to work harder and take his own learning more seriously. On the flip side, this may cause animosity between you and the teammate, and it also may cause leadership to view you as someone who is trying to sow discord amongst the company.</p>

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>

<p>Paul writes: "The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully" (2 Cor 9:6). This verse indicates that those who work shall receive reward. If someone decides to disrupt this, that is fine, and this may not even happen, but the Biblical concept of work and reward is present, which gives some justification for desiring to have credit for your own work.</p>

<h2>Response 2</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- Conflict with teammate avoided.
- Drama within workplace avoided.

<h4>Cons</h4>

- Rightful reward not received.
- May set a precedent for the teammate.

<h4>Dialog</h4>

<p>Another response to this prompt would be to remain silent and allow the teammate to take credit for work you have done and receive the raise. In doing so, you would be avoiding conflict with the teammate and you would also not start any drama within the workplace. However, you would not receive your rightful reward, which may hurt you. Also, this may set a precedent with the teammate to continue to take other people's credit unfairly.</p>

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>

<p>"Blessed are the meek, For they shall inherit the earth" (Matt 5:5). This verse indicates that meekness is a virtue indeed. Some may interpret this to justify remaining silent in circumstances which most would speak out in.</p>

<h2>Response 3</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- Problem addressed and confronted.
- Conflict contained between you two.

<h4>Cons</h4>

- Teammate may feel personally attacked.

<h4>Dialog</h4>

<p>A final response to this prompt would be to talk directly to the teammate and call him out/inform him personally, rather than taking it up with company management. In doing so, you would avoid company strife, and you would keep it between yourself and the teammate. You would also not be shying away from the problem. However, this may start conflict with the teammate, and it also may turn personal without company intervention. The teammate might feel personally attacked or offended.</p>

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>

<p>If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother (Matt 18:15). While this verse is in the context of the setting of the Church, it may be applied as a guideline for all confrontation. If this teammate has wronged you, knowing or not, you should confront him, first alone, as to not blow the situation up.

<font color="Orange"><h2>My Personal Choice</h2></font>

<p>My personal choice of response in this situation would be response 1. In approaching the leadership of the company first, you would be confronting the situation without having to go after the employee. Especially if the company is mistaken. You may be able to resolve the situation via the leadership without ever having to bring it up with the teammate. Especially if your teammate is not necissarily intentionally lying to the leadership. It is the leaderships mistake ultimately.
