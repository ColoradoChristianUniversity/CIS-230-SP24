>  <h1>üìùPrompt:</h1> While writing some code Saturday night, you realize you have introduced a crippling bug that breaks the entire system. As a Christian, you have politely requested no deadlines, meetings or work ever occur on Sunday. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

<h2> ‚úçÔ∏è <font color="Cyan">Response 1</font></h2>

<center>

üü¢ <font color="lightgreen">Pros</font> | üî¥ <font color="red">Cons</font> |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Problem assessed and possibly resolved .     | Responsibility taken.       |
| Commitment to not work on Sundays broken.   | Some coworkers may view this as hypocrisy.        | 

</center>

<font color="Cyan">___Dialogue___</font>

> One response to this issue would be to simply work and deal with the issue on Sunday. In doing so, you could call a meeting, assess the problem, and inform others of the problem, so it can be fixed. You would also be taking responsibility for your own actions. However, in doing this, you are going back on your commitment to not work on Sundays. Also, many of your coworkers may view this as hypocrisy or simply not taking your faith seriously.

<font color="Cyan">___Scripture___</font>

> In scripture, we can see that when the people of Israel sinned against the Lord by taking wives from foreign lands, they confessed to Ezra and declared,
> > "Arise, for it is your task, and we are with you; be strong and do it" (Ezra 10:4, ESV).
>
>This verse shwos us how the peopel of Israel immediatley responded and went to action when they commited a sin. This may apply in the same way for making a mistake, that one should immediatley rise and make it right.



<h2> ‚úçÔ∏è <font color="Cyan">Response 2</font></h2>

<center>

üü¢ <font color="lightgreen">Pros</font> | üî¥ <font color="red">Cons</font> |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| You would stand on your word, committed.     | Coworkers left in the dark (deceived almost?).       |
| Obedient to God's word.   | Coworkers also suffer.       | 

</center>

<font color="Cyan">___Dialogue___</font>

> A second response to this situation would be to commit to not working on Sunday. In doing so, you would be standing by your word, and being obedient to what you believe the Bible commands. Also, your coworkers may still respect this, despite the bug. However, you would be leaving them in the dark and as a result, they would have to deal with a problem that you created. 

<font color="Cyan">___Scripture___</font>

> The fourth commandment states,
> > "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates" (Ex. 20: 8-9).
>
>This verse, which was written by the finger of God, commands his people not to work on the Sabbath. One could interpret this verse literally, and if it is applied to us today, then surely one should not do any sort of work on Sunday, even if it means that your coworkers will suffer.

<h2> ‚úçÔ∏è <font color="Cyan">Response 3</font></h2>

<center>

üü¢ <font color="lightgreen">Pros</font> | üî¥ <font color="red">Cons</font> |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| a     | b       |
| c   | d       | 

</center>

<font color="Cyan">___Dialogue___</font>

> A final response to this prompt would be to notify your coworkers and to assist in any way that does not involve actual work. For example, sending emails, texting, or commiting to fixing the issue on Monday, or even buying lunch for the coworkers. In doing so, you keep your Sabbath commitment, and you also do not leave your coworkers in the dark. However, you may still be at risk of not keeping the Sabbath to its fullest, and you may also still receive the wrath of your coworkers for creating this problem, as they still ahve to deal with it.

<font color="Cyan">___Scripture___</font>

> Pauls writes,
> >"Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ" (Gal 6:2, ESV).
>
> We are called to bear the burderns of others, and this applies to one's self and others. Even if it is the Sabbath, one should help their coworkers in whatever way they can.

<h2> ‚úçÔ∏è <font color="Cyan">My Personal Choice</font></h2>

>My personal choice of responses for this assignment would response 1. Though your personal commitment to the Sabbath is commendable, two wrongs do not make a right. Leaving your coworkers in the dark with a detrimental bug is not okay, and you must at least let them know that it exists. While response 3 is also a great choice, I believe that you must personally at least help to fix the problem through working.
