>  <h1>üìùPrompt:</h1> You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets. The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until put under the scrutiny of your tool. They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better secularize public places. You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years. The product manager speculates it could potentially be licensed to foreign governments in the future wanting to accomplish similar goals. However, you also have misgivings. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

<h2> ‚úçÔ∏è <font color="Purple">Response 1</font></h2>

<center>

üü¢ <font color="lightgreen">Pros</font> | üî¥ <font color="red">Cons</font> |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Freedom of religion defended | Severe consequences from peers/government |
| Government influence on religion diminished |  | 

</center>

<font color="Purple">___Dialogue___</font>

> One response to this dilemma would be to shut down the software operation which you are working on. Many would say that it it not the government's place to restrict religion, even in public places. After all, if there are religious references in public places that are locally uncontested, that would mean that the people in said place are tolerant of said religion. Thus, the government should have no right to suppress it's citizen's own beliefs as Americans. In shutting down the operation (by means unknown), you would be defending citizen's right to freedom of religion all over the world potentially, and also preventing governemnt influence on religion. However, this would yeild severe consequences from your own teama nd the governemnt. 

<font color="Purple">___Scripture___</font>

> Peter writes,
> > "Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of God" (1 Peter 2:16, ESV).
>
> This verse can be interpreted to encourage a degree of freedom as regards to the gospel. This government-proposed software would absolutely restrict freedom to advocate or promote Christianity in many areas, which is not good. 

<h2> ‚úçÔ∏è <font color="Purple">Response 2</font></h2>

<center>

üü¢ <font color="lightgreen">Pros</font> | üî¥ <font color="red">Cons</font> |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Unbiased public places | Religion supressed |
| Secular government (Good? Bad?) | Potentially tyrannical rule | 

</center>

<font color="Purple">___Dialogue___</font>

> A second response would be to continue working on the project. One might say that the governemnt should be able to restrict religious implications within public places, as the government should be secular always. In continuing work on the project, you would be promoting unbiased public places and a secular government. However, this may supress many religions and also give the government potentially tyrannical rule by it's own standards.

<font color="Purple">___Scripture___</font>

> Again, Peter writes,
> > "Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good" (1 Peter 2:13-17 ESV)
>
> In this passage, Peter commands us to be subject to our higher institutions, such as the government. Some may say that this includes working for the government, and that there is nothing wrong with this software simply because the government commands it.

<h2> ‚úçÔ∏è <font color="Purple">Response 3</font></h2>

<font color="Purple">___Dialogue___</font>

> A final response would be to refuse to participate on thie project. this would be a very low-consequence option. In doing so, you would avoid the pain of conscious in not participating in a religion-suppressing scheme. However, you would still be doing nothing to stop it, and you also would suffer consequences from you peers undoubtably and the government.

<font color="Purple">___Scripture___</font>

> James writes,
> > "So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin" (Jas 4:17, ESV).
>
> It is clear that in leaving this project, you would be avoiding potential sin by participating in an oppressive project. We are commanded to do what is right in Scripture, and failing (refusing/avoiding) to do it is indeed sinful.

<h2> üß† <font color="Purple">My Personal Choice</font></h2>

> Between these options, I would personally choose response 1. I believe that under the United States's values of freedom of religion, people should be able to choose to celebrate/express their religion where they see fit. If there is a dispute, that should be left up to the state/city. The federal government should not be able to dictate what religious references can be expressed, even in public places. After all, the world is filled with religious references. Stopping this tyrannical software would be the right thing to do. Extreme forced secularization has never ended well for citizens.
