>  <h1>üìùPrompt:</h1> While volunteering to help with computers at your church, you are given access to giving records. Because of your work, you unexpectedly discover your senior pastor does not give anything to your church. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

<h2> ‚úçÔ∏è <font color="Cyan">Response 1</font></h2>

<center>

üü¢ <font color="lightgreen">Pros</font> | üî¥ <font color="red">Cons</font> |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Injustice/sin called out | Church most likely harmed |
| Truth revealed | Controversy | 

</center>

<font color="Cyan">___Dialogue___</font>

> One response to this dilemma would be to condemn your pastor for not giving to the church. In doing so, you would be calling out what you believe to be injustice and sin. In doing so, you would also be informing the congregation of truth. However, you certianly would leave the church in shambles and would probably start a great deal of controversy and issues.

<font color="Cyan">___Scripture___</font>

> In the book of Numbers it is commanded,
> > "Moreover, you shall speak and say to the Levites, 'When you take from the people of Israel the tithe that I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall present a contribution from it to the Lord, a tithe of the tithe'" (Num 18:26).
>
> The presence of tithes is clearly present in Scripture, and is found in many other places. We as Christians are called to be generous and support our local churches. This does not exclude the lead pastor. One may say that not paying tithes is sinful, and would be especially bad when a lead pastor does not tithe to God's church.

<h2> ‚úçÔ∏è <font color="Cyan">Response 2</font></h2>

<center>

üü¢ <font color="lightgreen">Pros</font> | üî¥ <font color="red">Cons</font> |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Controversy avoided | Potential sin/injustice ignored? |
| Pastor aided financially |  | 

</center>

<font color="Cyan">___Dialogue___</font>

> Another response to this situation would be to do nothing. Many would argue that because the senior pastor oversees the church and its money (in many cases), and that tithes are intended to pay pastors, the pastor should be exampt from paying the tithe. Keeping quiet would not change much, and controversy would be avoided. However, you may be ignoring a significant potential problem of injustice or even sin.

<font color="Cyan">___Scripture___</font>

> Concerning tithes, God commands Israel to tithe in order to support the Levite priests:
> > "To the Levites I have given every tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service that they do, their service in the tent of meeting" (Num 18:11).
>
> This verse indicates that at the time of the Levitical law, tithes were intended to support the priests. So why should the Levites pay a tithe to support themselves? Aren't they serving the Lord already as priests, after all? Aren't today's pastors under the same calling?

<h2> ‚úçÔ∏è <font color="Cyan">Response 3</font></h2>

<center>

üü¢ <font color="lightgreen">Pros</font> | üî¥ <font color="red">Cons</font> |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Concerns not ignored | Still potential turmoil? |
| Church stability maintained | Possible angry response form clergy | 

</center>

<font color="Cyan">___Dialogue___</font>

> A final response would be that of inquiry. Instead of accusing or exclaming, inquire. A response could be to ask questions and bring up verses in private with the elders/deacons or even the pastor himself. Also, observing the character and intentions of the pastor can indicate wether him not tithing is out of malicious intent or not. This does not ignore the concerns, and maintains church stability. However, this may still lead to drama within the church, or even an angry response from the lead pastor.

<font color="Cyan">___Scripture___</font>

> For this issue, we can go to the classic verse regarding sin in the church:
> > "'If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over. But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that ‚Äòevery matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.‚Äô If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector'" (Matt 18:15-17)
>
> This verse shows us how to approach sin. In this case, the 'sin' is up for debate, but the method of confrontation remains the same. One should bring the matter up personally, before escalating if need be.

<h2> üß† <font color="Cyan">My Personal Choice</font></h2>

> My personal choice for this week's dilemma would be response 3. I am not certain on my position regarding whether a pastor should tithe or not, but I am certian that the correct response should not be fire and ammunition. This is a matter which requires careful inquiry and multiple opinions, while taking into consideration the senior pastor's intents. This third response covers all ground while being well-tempered.
