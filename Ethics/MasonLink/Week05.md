# Week 05 Ethics

Prompt: Just a week or two into class, one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. Too good? You check and discover the code is identical to a C# tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. The writing is on the wall. But remember, you love this student: you don't want to overreact. But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: you don't want to underreact. A lot to think about. What do you do?

<h2>Response 1</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- Retain high standards as professer.
- Follow the University policy on plagarism.

<h4>Cons</h4>

- Possible overlook of student's intent or any gray areas.
- Harsh response, no attempt to communicate.

<h4>Dialog</h4>

<p> The first response to this situation would be to call the student out on their plagarism and fail them in the course, in addition to reporting them. In doing so, I would be upholding my high standards as a professor and also act according to the university's rules on plagarism. However, I would also be overlooking the student's intent or any other gray areas, and I would be somewhat harsh in dealing with the problem. Overall, however, there would be no fault in failing the student from the satndpoint of the Univercity policy and duty as a professor. </p>

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>

<p> "Seek the LORD and live, lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, with none to quench it for Bethel, O you who turn justice to wormwood and cast down righteousness to the earth! But let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream." (Amos 5:7 ESV). This verse speaks to Gods encouragement of justice. There is no problem with ensuring justice on earth, especially in a clear-cut case of plagarim on a college campus. </p>

<h2>Response 2</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- Confrontation avoided
- Retain reputation as an easygoing professer.

<h4>Cons</h4>

- School policy ignored.
- Justice ignored.

<h4>Dialog</h4>

<p> A second response to this situation would be to no punish the student at all. In doing so, you would avoid confrontation with the student, and you would retain a preutation as an easygoing, peaceful teacher. However, you would not be acting in accordance with school policy and you would also be neglecting justice. In addition to this, you would neglect to gain any understanding or communication with the student about the situation. </p>

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>

<p> "Calm your anger and abandon wrath. Don’t be angry— it only leads to evil" (Ps 37:8). This Psalm can be interpreted as encouragement to be calm, not taking things too seriously, as anger or wrath can lead to evil. In this situation, one may interpret this verse as to not punish the student in an effort to avoid anger, wrath, or unjust punishment. </p>

<h2>Response 3</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- More informaton on the situation would be gained
- A fairer descision would be reached.

<h4>Cons</h4>

- Justice Delayed.
- Reputation altered.

<h4>Dialog</h4>

<p> A final response to this promt would be to reach out to the student and hear them out on what happened regarding the apparent plagarism. By withholding judgement, you would have an opportunity to gain more information and understanding of the situation, and you would be making a more fair decision. However, you would be delaying justice and punishment as the schools policy demands. In addition to this, many students would view you as a soft, easy professor who did not punish any wrongdoing.

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>

<p> "Making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding; yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding, if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures, then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God" (Prov 2:2-5 ESV). This proverb shows the inportance of understanding and wisdom. In choosing to listen to the student before executing justice, it heeds God's word of seeking out knowledge and understanding. </p>

<h2>My Personal Choice</h2>

<p> I would personally align with reponse three. Although it is clear that the student in question did indeed plagarize, I believe hearing what the student has to say is important to understanding the situation as a whole. Whiel they may be in the wrong and deserve to be punished, at least an accurate display and understanding of the character and mind of the student can be gained. This is valuable. </p>
