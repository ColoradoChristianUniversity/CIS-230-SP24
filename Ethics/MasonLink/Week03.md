# Week 03 Ethics

Prompt: While maintaining an extremely popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three responses? What do you do?

<h2>Response 1</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- Assist in thwarting a trafficking scheme.
- Obedience to authroities.

<h4>Cons</h4>

- Security of open-sourced project jeopardized.
- Users of project are put at risk.


<h4>Dialog</h4>
    <p>One response to this situation would be to let the authorities introduce this back-door code. You would be assisting in thwarting a trafficking scheme, and you would also be obeying your authorites, which is right. However, you would also be jeopardizing the security of your open-source project. This puts its users at risk and gives the authorities sway and influence in the supposedly open-source project. </p>

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>
    <p>Paul writes, "Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God" (Rom 13:1, ESV). If the authorites that be command you to do something you should obey, unless it causes you to sin. This is a general Christian principle rooted in verses such as these. Also, the authorites are asking you to do something that actually makes a difference in stopping a especially evil act from takign place. This verse supports obeying the authority's wishes.</p>

<h2>Response 2</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- Security maintained.
- Trust with users upheld.

<h4>Cons</h4>

- Hurts authorities efforts to stop a trafficking scheme.
- Disobedience to authorities.

<h4>Dialog</h4>
    <p>Another response to the situation at hand would be to <i>refuse</i> to obey the authorites and let them introduce the back-door code. In doing so, you would be maintaining the security of your open-source project and also maintaining the trust of those who use it, who beleive it to be open-source and not influenced by thrid-parties. However, you would be inhibiting the authorities ability to stop a child trafficking scheme, and you would also be disobeying them. This is something to reckon with.</p>

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>
    <p>Moses's father-in-law said, "Moreover, look for able men from all the people, men who fear God, who are trustworthy and hate a bribe, and place such men over the people as chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens" (Ex 18:21, ESV). Moses obeys his father-in-law in this chapter of Exodus, and it is clear that he made the right decision. Accepting a back-door code would be breaking the trust of your users, and this is unbiblical, as we can see in this verse.</p>

<h2>Response 3</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- Transparency with users.
- Attempt to cooperate with authorities as well.

<h4>Cons</h4>

- Authorites may not want to work with you due to transparency with users.
- Users will most likely drop your project.

<h4>Dialog</h4>
    <p>A final approach to this situation would be a more middle-of-the-road approach. One could accept the back-doro code but then disclose to users that your open-source project is collecting data for authorities. This would aid in stopping the trafficking scheme, while also maintaining transparency with your users. However, as a result o this, users may stop using your project, and your project may be viewed as unreliable. This descision may also lead to issues with the authorities, who do not want the back-door code to be made known (else it is no longer back-door). This creates a risk that the authorities will not cooperate with you and the trafficking scheme is not uncovered.</p>

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>
    <p>"To do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice" (Prv 21:3, ESV). With this decision, you do what is right in both scenarios, despite the risks. According to this verse, doing what is righteous and just is commendable, and this reponse attempts to do what is righteous for both sides.</p>

<h2>My Personal Choice</h2>
    <p>My personal response would be the first. I think that stopping the child trafficking scheme is more important than the security of the open-source project, and that the highest likelihood of the trafficking scheme being thwarted would be to let the authorities introduce the back-door code. The projects reputation and trust  come second, I think.</p>
