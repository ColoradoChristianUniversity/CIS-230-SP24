<font color="Cyan"><h1># Week 15 Ethics</h1></font>

>  <h1>üìùPrompt:</h1> You are a software engineer working for a marketing firm that has been hired by a tobacco company to analyze data for a new product. Your team is excited to work on this project because it could save your struggling company during a bad economy. However, you suspect the customer is intending the product for young audiences, but you are not sure. To make matters worse, you have been trying to build a relationship with a coworker who has criticized religion as judgmental; you are worried that taking a moral stand against this product could come across as hypocritical and cause you to lose the opportunity to reach him just as he is softening to spiritual conversations. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

üü¢ <font color="lightgreen">Pros</font> | üî¥ <font color="red">Cons</font> |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Committing/standing up for personal beliefs | Jeporadizing company |
| Preventing tobacco from reaching the youth | Relationship with coworker ruined | 

</center>

<font color="Cyan">___Dialogue___</font>

> One resposne to this situation would be to take a moral stand against working on the tobacco product. Many would say that tobacco should not be marketed towards the youth, and supporting that would be supporting harmful behavior. In taking a religious stand against the product, you would be standing by what you believe and possibly prevent or hindering tobacco reaching the youth. However, you would be somewhat jeopardizing the company and ruining your relationship with your coworker, preventing future conversations with him.

<font color="Cyan">___Scripture___</font>

> Pauls letter to the Corinthians says, 
> > "Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong," (1 Cor 16:13, ESV).
>
> Many would say that standing up against advocating for harmful substances amongst the youth would be Biblical, due to this verse which clearly indicates that we should firm in what we believe in as regards to the faith.

<center>

üü¢ <font color="lightgreen">Pros</font> | üî¥ <font color="red">Cons</font> |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Company saved | Tobacco possibly more accessable to youth |
| Good relationship maintained |  | 

</center>

<font color="Cyan">___Dialogue___</font>

> A second response to this situation would be to continue to work on the product. While you may disagree personally, many would say that it is up to the parents of the youth to make sure their children are not using harmful substances. And if they are old enough to smoke, then they are old enough to make their own descisions. In doing so, you would be aiding your company and it's coworkers, as well as your relationship with your coworker friend. However, tobacco would certianly be more accessable to the youth and you would be aiding this.

<font color="Cyan">___Scripture___</font>

> Peter writes to the Christians in Asia Minor,
> > "Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins" (1 Pet 4:8, ESV).
>
> In this verse, we can understand that loving others is very valuable. In this case, loving your coworkers and friends is to be of great importance, even if it means opening a door for others to be tempted. However, it can be argued that others will have to be responsible for their own actions.

<h2> ‚úçÔ∏è <font color="Cyan">Response 3</font></h2>

<center>

üü¢ <font color="lightgreen">Pros</font> | üî¥ <font color="red">Cons</font> |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Approaching discourse first | Risk of conflict |
| Others opinions prioritized |  | 

</center>

<font color="Cyan">___Dialogue___</font>

> A final response to this situation would be to attempt to convince your other coworkers to not work with the product. In doing so you may retain relationships with others, while also avoiding aiding the company. This will at least prioritize other's opinions and sentiments on the situation. However, this is a very risky option, as it may result in failure on both ends. 

<font color="Cyan">___Scripture___</font>

> The Proverbs says,
> > "A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity" (Prov 17:17, ESV).
>
> This verse indicates that a friend will not sow discord or adversity. In trying to convince others not to work with the product, you are at least avoiding conflict and adversity amongst your coworkers/friends by approaching them.

<h2> üß† <font color="Cyan">My Personal Choice</font></h2>

My personal choice of a response to this dilemma would be response 2. I belive that every person is responsible to have self-control and has a choice not to sin (via harming their own body with tobacco). The youth who may be exposed to tobacco still have a choice not to use it, and as long as this is the case, then supporting the company and relationships with coworkers seems like the best option. Especially when a coworker is interested in the faith somewhat.
