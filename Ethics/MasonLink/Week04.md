# Week 04 Ethics

Prompt: While working on a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three responses? What do you do?

<h2>Response 1</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- Your project is most likely to be finished on time.
- The company's well-being will be prioritized.

<h4>Cons</h4>

- The needs of your teammate are put at risk.
- The project is put at risk due to faulty management.

<h4>Dialog</h4>

<p> One response to this situation would be to continue on the project, neglecting your teammate's needs and pressing on. In doing this, you prioritize your project and will most likely finish it on time, and will retain the company's largest customer. However, by neglecting the needs of your teammate, you are putting his well-being at risk. In addition to this, the efficiency and quality of your project may decrease as a result. Even worse, your project may be put at risk. </p>

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>

<p> "The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing, while the soul of the diligent is richly supplied" (Prov 13:4, ESV). This proverb shows us that diligence is to be sought after. In the same way, and argument can be made to prioritize the work set before one's self. The project should be prioritized over teammates, at least until it is finished, one may argue.

<h2>Response 2</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- Human livelihood and value upheld.
- Team efficiency and health retained.

<h4>Cons</h4>

- Porject put at risk.
- Business and company health put at risk.

<h4>Dialog</h4>

<p>A second response to this situation would be to prioritize the teammate over the project. One may argue that the well-being of a person should take precedence over a mere project. Though the stakes are high, the livelihood of a person is the most important. In this approach, you value human livelihood, which is the right thing to do. You also make sure that the efficiency of your team is taken seriously, possibly increasing efficiency on the current/future projects. However, this approach does put the project at risk due to delay and changed priorities. Also, if you company's largest customer is lost, the business may fail or be severly depleted, which puts the whole team at risk.
</p>

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>

<p> "Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one another..." (Col 3:12-13, ESV). Paul indicates that compassion and "bearing with" another are to be "put on". With this in mind, we can look at this situation and determine that from a Biblical perspective, we should address and aid those in need or who are suffering.</p>

<h2>Response 3</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- Prioritize both the teammate and the project.
- Teammate receives help.

<h4>Cons</h4>

- Project is put at risk.
- Teammate still at risk.

<h4>Dialog</h4>

<p> Another response to this delimma would be to find a way to manage the teammate and the project. Whether this would be taking/dividing the teammates hours, delaying the project slightly, or both. Explaining and demanding for more time or budget may be necessary. In doing so, you at least do as much as you can. While you put yourself and you rcompany at risk, you do not brush either side off. Your teammate may also still be at risk, if the customer demands the same time window and nothing can be done.

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>

<p> "See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil" (Eph 5:15). This verse speaks to the fact that we should consider our time and walk wisely. In managing your own time and resources in this situation, you may be able to work out a compromise that prioritizes the project and your own teammate, "redeeming the time", as the verse states. </p>

<h2>My Personal Choice</h2>

<p>My personal choice would be the final one, as it is the most middle-of-the-road. However, it incurs risks from both parties, the teammate and the customer. In my opinion, though risky, this would be the best choice because the value of human livelihood and compassion is important, as is the sucess of your own company (which others may also rely on). The company is greater than just yourself, and its value is almost as significant as the teammate, who also relies on the paycheck of the company. Thus, both should be prioritized.</p>
