# Week 07 Ethics

Prompt: A junior engineer at your company, leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence, has completed a critical software project well ahead of schedule. The AI has written almost the entire application, raising questions about the engineer's understanding of the project's intricacies. Despite this, the company's management, impressed by the speedy delivery, is planning to integrate this AI-generated software into major systems immediately. You are concerned but you are also friends with this junior developer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

<h2>Response 1</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- Risk of faulty project avoided.
- Junior programmer better off in the long run.

<h4>Cons</h4>

- Junior programmer's reputation and confidence potentialyl ruined.
- Speedy project delivery halted.

<h4>Dialog</h4>

<p> My first response to this situation would be to not integrate the software, and instead call the programmer out on his project. In doing so, you would prevent any software that could potentially harm the company's systems. Also, you would be encouraging the junior programmer to take their work more seriously. However, you will lose the benefits of a speedy project delivery, and you may also damage the junior programmers reputation and confidence.</p>

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>

<p> "The desires of the lazy will kill them, because their hands refuse to do anything" (Prov 21:25). This verse speaks to the quality of hard work which does not slack. While the junior programmer may not have been lazy necessarily, they should have spent the time and work towards understanding the project and knowing how it works.</p>

<h2>Response 2</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- Speedy project delivery.
- Friendship with junior programmer retained.

<h4>Cons</h4>

- Code uncertianty not addressed.
- Junior developer encouraged to continue this behavior.

<h4>Dialog</h4>

<p> A second response to this situation would be to admit the project, despite the suspicions regarding the project's validity. In doing so, you would be gaining the benefits of a speedy project delivery, and you would also be retaining good friendship and standing with the junior developer. However, the downsides to this would be the uncertianty regarding the AI-generated code. Also, the junior developer would be encouraged to continue this practice.</p>

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>

<p> "Do not be deceived: â€œBad company ruins good morals" (1 Cor 15:33). Some may interpret this verse as demonstrating the importance of keeping good company. In keeping good company with the junior developer by not calling him out, you may be retaining good morals according to Paul. </p>

<h2>Response 3</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- No future risk of uncertian projects.
- No tolerence demonstrated for overuse of AI in the workplace.

<h4>Cons</h4>

- Possible culture of fear in the workplace.
- Friendship most-likely destroyed. 

<h4>Dialog</h4>

<p> A final response to this issue would be to take a harsher stand and simply fire the junior developer. If this route were to be taken, it would eliminate the risk of future projects being compromised by uncertian work. Also, it would demonstrate no tolerence for slacking or over-reliance on AI. However, this would also probably scare the workers in the company, and would surely destroy your friendship with the junior developer.</p>

<h4>Biblical Reference</h4>

<p> "For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it" (Heb 12:11). This verse may be interpreted to encourage discipline of those in the wrong, in order to preserve righteousness. In firing the developer, you may retain workplace integrity and righteouness. Possibly. </p>

<h2>My Personal Choice</h2>

<p> In this situation, I would definitely choose option 1. This is because the junior developer most likley had good intentions in using AI to speed the poject. However, by calling him out, you are expressing that this is not ok, without overreacting. After all, this is a junior developer. Finally, the risky project can be addressed, and the possible system problems due to the lack of understanding of the project is avoided.</p>
